Summary of the sessions - Sunday 25/04/21 IPS UG/PG education subcommittee discussion forum

Dr. Deepa (use of analogies)
1. Control vs cure - analogy of glasses, 
2.  Use a question answer format rather than direct method

My comments - alternative analogy (what I use in practice) of caging a lion, for an educated pt I use the analogy of antihypertensive for HTN

Dr. Aarthi (innovative teaching practices)
1. Content matters, methods matter
2. Old is gold
3. Hands on training
4. New methods - flipped classroom, active use of social media, ocses, virtual workshops

My comments 
1. Simulations
2. please checkout our student teaching app at psychclerk.github.io which incorporates use of social media, humanities, teaching osces etc. Still a work in progress. Create a login by entering credentials and clicking on the register button. 

Dr. Usha (Students perspective)

2.  Magic of drugs - biological model
3.  Observing clinicians work their magic
4. Liaison
5.  Handle moral dilemmas
6. Make safe environment for learning

My comments
1. Clinicians must help the student make sense of the encounter - what happened, making the implicit - explicit
