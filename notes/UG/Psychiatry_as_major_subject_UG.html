# [Das et al Indian J Psychiatry 2020;62:723-7](https://www.indianjpsychiatry.org/text.asp?2020/62/6/723/303186)
- Shared their rationale and experience of including Psychiatry as a major subject in UG curriculum with seperate practical exams in 3rd MBBS.
- Student's perspective about the exam
  - Most of the students reported that this examination **improved their knowledge**
  - Most of the students recognized that separate examination for psychiatry **changed their perspective** and would help them in future. 
  - Most of the students found examination **method satisfactory**.
  - Almost all students felt that **theory examination was tougher than they expected**.
- Examiner's perspective 
  - Found that the examination process was satisfactory
  - A need for greater exposure to cases falling under the gamut of anxiety disorders, depression, and insomnia, which are more common in practice, was felt.
- Lessons learnt 
  - Feasible to do 
  - Use of clinical vignettes in MCQs, although labor intensive to design, is known to examine multiple aspects during the assessment and bring uniformity in the assessment process
  - Use of various elements (OSLER, OSCE, and unobserved stations) meant that the students are tested both in their ability to elicit (OSCE; also, OSLER) and communicate (OSLER) their findings.
  - Examination showed a need to further emphasize conditions and situations that the IMG is likely to face, such as depression, anxiety disorders, insomnia, and alcohol use disorders.

# [Mishra et al Ind Psychiatry J 2021;30:102-5]( https://www.industrialpsychiatry.org/text.asp?2021/30/1/102/315775) Access date 04/07/21
- Stipulated period for psychiatry training in MBBS curriculum is 2 weeks clinical posting and 20h theory lectures 
- Study done to assess attendance during psychiatry clinical posting and theory classes 
- Group A = govt. college 
- Group B = private college 
- **Results:** Only 27% of the students in Group A attended 25%–30% of clinical posting, whereas none of them attended a single theory class. While in Group B, 1/3rd of students attended 30%–40% of clinical posting and 20%–25% of theory class. No separate examination in the subject (88%–94%) and adjustment of attendance in the other major subjects (64–86%) were cited as main reasons for nonattendance among the majority of the students in both the groups.
- **Conclusions**: Strict adherence to the attendance by the institutional authority, increase in the training hours and **separate examination in the subject** at undergraduate level may help in improving the attendance and change in attitude of the students toward psychiatry.
