# What does a "high-dose" prescription mean?
- Prescription of either a single antipsychotic medication at a dose above the recommended maximum OR
- Two or more antipsychotic medications concurrently that, when expressed as a percentage of their respective maximum recommended doses and added together, result in a cumulative dose of more than 100%

# Are high-dose antipsychotics effective?
- No firm evidence that high doses of antipsychotic medication are any more effective than standard doses for schizophrenia. [Dold et al Schizophrenia Res 2015;166:187-93](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26008883)
- In a study of patients with first-episode schizophrenia, increasing the dose of olanzapine up to 30 mg/day and the dose of risperidone up to 10 mg/day in non-responders to standard doses yielded only a 4% absolute increase in overall response rate; switching to an alternative antipsychotic, including clozapine, was considerably more successful. [Agid et al J Clin Psychiatry 2011;72:1439-44](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21457676)
- A systematic review of relevant studies comparing olanzapine at above standard dosage with clozapine for TRS concluded that while olanzapine, particularly in higher dosage, might be considered as an alternative to clozapine in TRS, clozapine still had the most robust evidence for efficacy [Souza et al CNS Spectr 2013;18:82-9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23253621)

# Recommendations
- Use of high-dose antipsychotic medication should be an exceptional clinical practice and only ever employed when adequate trials of standard treatments, including clozapine, have failed
- Should be done in a measurement based manner with close monitoring of metabolic and cardiac parameters 

# Prescribing high-dose antipsychotics
## Before using 
- At least two different antipsychotic medications have been tried sequentially
- Clozapine has been tried and failed or  intolerable due to side effects or agranulocytosis 
- Medication adherence is not in doubt (use of blood tests, liquids, depot preparations)

## Practice points 
- Decision to use should be made by senior psych in consultation with a multidisciplinary team and if possible with patients informed consent 
- Workup - ECG, Electrolytes, LFT to r/o QTc, Hepatic impairment, Dyselectrolytemia
- Avoid concomitant QTc prolonging medications and CYP inter-actors
- Document decisions
- Allow time before increasing dose 
- Measurement based care: reassess at 6weeks and 3 months; if insufficient improvement has occurred reduce dose to normal range
- Close monitoring of metabolic and cardiac parameters
