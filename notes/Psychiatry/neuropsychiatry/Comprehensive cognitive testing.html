# Screening - MMSE

Where cognitive abnormalities are likely, the Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a useful first step. This was devised to test cognitive function in the elderly but is used as a screening test throughout clinical practice. Since impaired concentration or slowness are often due to depression or anxiety rather than actual deficits, these factors need to be carefully documented and allowance made for them. If major abnormalities are revealed, a full cognitive examination is necessary.

# Comprehensive testing

A comprehensive list of cognitive tests is outlined below. They not only
reveal cognitive problems but also point to the area of brain affected. In patients with global problems such as Alzheimer’s disease, comprehensive cognitive testing identifies areas of deficiency that require attention in treatment or rehabilitation.

In some patients, it is not possible to perform the MMSE because of poor cooperation, mutism, sedation, gross confusion or incoherence due to formal thought disorder. If this is the case, record the reasons accurately. At the least, it is important to document conscious state, including orientation for person, place and time, particularly if fluctuations occur.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1\. Conscious state** |     |
| Wakefulness | A - Alert <br>V - response to verbal <br>P - response to pain <br>U - unresponsive |
| Awareness | Orientation to time, place, person and situation |
| **2\. Attention and concentration** | Observe the ability to focus and sustain attention; test and record quality and speed of performance of (try to find best performance)<br>\- days of the week backwards<br>\- months of the year backwards<br>\- serial 7s (or serial 3s)<br>\- sequence of digits, forwards and backwards.<br>Concentration reflects emotional state, general cortical and frontal-lobe function. |
| **3\. Memory** |     |
| Immediate recall | Ask patient to name three objects (e.g. pen, apple, cat). Ask them to repeat the three objects and mention that you will ask again in a few minutes. |
| Short-term recall | After 3–5 minutes, ask patient to repeat the three objects. |
| Long-term memory | Ask facts that can be checked (from history). Observe responses to questions such as ‘Where were you born?'or ‘What school did you go to?’ or ‘When did you get married?’ Remember that memory performance depends on general state (emotional and general cortical function) as well as specific brain structures such as the dominant temporal lobe. |
| General information | Ask about recent events (e.g. breakfast and ward activities, recent prime ministers).<br><br>Consider set test: ‘Name ten colours, ten fruit, ten animals, ten capitals’; this is a good test of memory in dementia (suspect if score <20). |
| Confabulation | Note if spontaneous, or attempt to induce if vague (‘Haven’t I met you before?’). |
| **4\. Language** |     |
| Note handedness | For localization |
| Motor aspects | Patients requested to say the bisyllabic phrase “PATA” or “PATAKA” as many times as possible in a defined amount of time, for example PATA 10 seconds and PATAKA for 15 seconds. |
| Fluency | observed during history taking |
| Comprehension | Always check hearing first.<br><br>Ask to point to bodily parts (also testing parietal lobe).<br><br>Marie’s three-paper test: give three pieces of paper and state, ‘Keep the biggest, give the middle size to me and throw away the smallest’. |
| Repetition | Ask to repeat the "No, ifs and or buts" |
| Reading | Read "Close your eyes" or Read a para from a newspaper or magazine |
| Perserveration | Note if present (repetition of a response when no longer appropriate.) |
| **5\. Parietal tests** |     |
| Observations for | Any side neglect |
| Visuospatial function | Ask to copy a complex figure (constructional dyspraxia). |
| Dyspraxia | Give a complex command and observe performance (e.g. ask to fold a piece of paper, put it in an envelope and seal it); watch how patient undresses or dresses for examination (dressing dyspraxia). |
| Topographical orientation | Ask to draw a plan of the ward. |
| Number function | Already tested in serial 7s but can give more difficult operations. |
| Body image | For right–left orientation and identification of body parts, ask to perform relevant commands (e.g. touch left ear lobe with right ring finger); for finger gnosis, ask to name fingers; ask to draw a person. |
| Test stereognosis and graphesthesia |     |
| **6\. Frontal tests** |     |
| Abstraction | Ask to interpret a proverb (a poor test since it depends on educational attainment); test understanding of similarities and differences (a good test in impaired abstracting ability), e.g. ‘In what ways do a child and a dwarf differ and in what ways are they similar?’ |
| Sequence task | Write randomly on a page A to G and 1 to 7 in two columns; ask to connect letters and numbers in sequences (i.e. A–1–B–2–C–3 and so on) and watch performance. |
| Problem solving | ‘There are nine books on two shelves. The top shelf has twice as many as the bottom shelf. How many books on each shelf?’ |
| Reciprocal coordination | Alternate motor task (e.g. sequential tapping with both hands). |
