# Basic Pathology
- **Chronic exposure to manganese**
   - mcc inhalation -> manganese miners [[video](https://youtu.be/T-N50K8wXck "manganese miners ")] / steel / battery factory
   - contaminated well water
   - prolonged TPN
   - IV abuse of methcathionine (stimulant made using potassium permanganate)

# Clinical Features
- After months or years of exposure
- Parkinsonism
	- TRAP [original [video](https://youtu.be/sBRcQOXRHvM) of Chilean miners published in Neurology in 1960's]
	- *cock walk* - [patients walk on their metatarsophalangeal joints as if they were wearing high heels; at times, the elbows may be flexed, creating the overall appearance of the walk of a rooster], [video](https://youtu.be/GCrmSelWrnk "cock walk video of battery factory workers from Thailand")
- Personality change
	- emotional incontinence similar to pseudobulbar palsy [[video](https://youtu.be/T-N50K8wXck?t=296 "pseudobulbar affect in manganese miners")]
- Dementia - marked degree of memory loss
- Psychosis [manganese madness]
- worsen over 10 years despite withdrawal of exposure

# Imaging and Labs
- T1
	- increased signal intensity b/l globus pallidius
	- pallidal index = degree of T1 hyperintensity - correlates with the level of lifetime exposure
- 24 hr urine
	- increased level of manganese

# DD
- other causes of parkinsonism
	- late onset NBIA
	- WD
	- CBGD
	- PSP

# Rx
- Chelating agents
- Symptomatic
	- personality change
	- dementia
	- psychosis
		- quetiapine [preferred to prevent worsening of parkinsonism]
	- parkinsonism - levodopa
