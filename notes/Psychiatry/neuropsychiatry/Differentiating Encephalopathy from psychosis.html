# Case - initial
- 57/m
- involuntary psychiatric commitment
- on presentation
	- paranoid [felt was being followed, friend wanted to kill him] x 1 month
- no known past medical or psychiatric history
- irritable mood
- MoCA 18/30
- poor insight
- Slow responses to question
- Bradykinesia
- Prov CI - Schizophrenia spectrum disorder -> started on Risperidone 1mg/day

# Case - progress
- no improvement after 2 weeks
- due to non-response + lack of past and family h/o, other D/Ds were pursued
   - meningoencephalitis
   - delirium
   - Lewy body dementia
   - dementia with behavioral disturbance
   - frontotemporal dementia
   - Parkinson’s disease
   - anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis

# Diagnostic tests
- Brain CT and MRI, EEG, Urine drug screen, rapid plasma reagin, NMDA antibodies, and lumbar puncture serology/immunology testing

- **Negative Results**
	- Imaging and EEG
	- Urine drug screen
	- CBC
	- NMDA testing
	- Inflammatory panel
      - Rheumatoid factor
      - ANA pattern
      - c-ANCA, p-ANCA
      - anti-proteinase 3, and anti-myeloperoxidase
	- Infective panel
      - syphilis
      - HIV
      - tuberculosis
	- Lumbar puncture
      - CSF alpha 1-globulin, alpha 2-globulin, beta globulin, gamma globulin, beta 2-microglob
      - serum protein electrophoresis M spike
      - Venereal Disease Research Laboratory Test
      - Lyme immunoglobulin G/M (IgG/IgM)
      - coccidiosis IgG
      - cryptococcus Ag
      - herpes DNA
      - toxoplasma IgM/IgG
      - varicella-zoster virus DNA

- **Positive results**
	- CSF
		- elevated CSF IgG
		- increased IgG synthesis rate
		- elevated total protein
	- TFT
		- TSH 1.340 uIU/mL (N)
		- FT4 1.04 ng/dl (L)
		- Anti-TPO 39.4 (H)
	- Serology
		- elevated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) capsid Ag IgG and EBV nuclear antigen antibodies
		- CRP 0.40 (increased)
		- ESR 14 (increased)

# Case - Progress
- on the basis of the presentation and elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies, the patient was diagnosed as having Hashimoto’s encephalopathy
- methylprednisolone sodium succinate (1,000 mg intravenous infusion, over 24 hours for 5 days)
- Treatment with steroids led to resolution of the patient’s delusions and paranoia. His mental status and cognitive function returned to his baseline, and the patient was discharged home

# Discussion
- Psychiatrists must maintain a broad differential diagnosis for non-psychiatricS causes of acute psychosis that do not fit the normal clinical picture.
- Hashimoto's
	- most patients with Hashimoto’s encephalopathy present euthyroid at the time of diagnosis
	- Often under recognized
	- Presentations vary
		- Psychiatric [psychosis, depression, dementia] to Neurological [stroke, seizure, tremor, myoclonus]
	- Treatment of choice includes high-dose prednisone (1–2 mg/kg) for up to 4–6 weeks, followed by a slow taper to avoid recurrence
