# Longitudinal course of cognition in schizophrenia
- Patients who develop schizophrenia, on average, demonstrate cognitive impairment beginning as early as the first grade, with deterioration seen across school years. [J Clin Psychiatry 2014;75:8-13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24919165/)
- Examination of school records suggests that children who will eventually develop schizophrenia begin school at a level of functioning that is a full grade behind their peers, with the gap increasing by the time they finish high school. [J Clin Psychiatry 2014;75:8-13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24919165/)
- The widening gap towards healthy adolescence appears mainly to be based in a developmental lag rather than a loss of acquired functions. [Schizophr Bull 2016;42:87–95](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4681546/)
- There are, however, no direct indications of a cognitive decline from the prodrome/high‐risk state to the onset of the first episode. [Schizophr Bull 2016;42:87–95](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4681546/)
- Cognitive effects in patients with schizophrenia are robust, with a 1.5 to 2.5 standard deviation gap between patients and healthy controls on composite scores. [J Clin Psychiatry 2014;75:8-13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24919165/)
- Measurements of functional outcome are highly correlated with the degree of neurocognitive impairment in schizophrenia [Am J Psychiatry 1996;153:321-30](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8610818/)
- Increasing evidence suggests that social cognition mediates the relationship between neurocognition and functional outcome [ J Int Neuropsychol Soc 2008;14:279-88](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18282325/)

# A bottom-up model of functional outcome in schizophrenia
[Sci Rep 2021;11:7577](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33828168/)

- A cross-sectional sample of 135 individuals with schizophrenia and 78 controls
- Using a series of structural equation modelling analyses, a single pathway was generated among scores from the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), vocal emotion recognition test, Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS), Brief Negative Symptom Scale, and the Personal and Social Performance Scale.
- On path analysis modelling, the proposed bottom-up causal model showed a strong fit with the data and formed a single pathway, from neurocognition to vocal emotional cognition, to alexithymia, to negative symptoms, and to poor functional outcomes.

Figure : Final Model. This figure is the final, trimmed model after modifications. It shows a single path running through cognition, vocal emotion cognition, alexithymia, negative symptom, and functional outcome.
