- NICE guideline recommendation on medication adherence 
  - patients should be involved as possible in decisions about the choice of medicines
  - clinicians should be aware that illness beliefs and beliefs about medicines influence adherence
- NICE guideline on Schizophrenia 
  - emphasises the importance of patient choice rather than specifically recommending a class or individual antipsychotic as first‐line treatment

Antipsychotics differ in their pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, overall efficacy/effectiveness and tolerability, but perhaps more importantly, response and tolerability differ between patients. This variability of individual response means that **there is no clear first‐line antipsychotic medication that is preferable for all**.
