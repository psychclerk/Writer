# Background: 
- ADHD diagnosed in 2.4% pre-school age children
- Stimulants are recommended as first line agents 
- However, up to 25% of preschool-age children with ADHD are treated with α2-adrenergic agonist medications

# Objective 
- To determine the frequency of reported improvement in ADHD symptoms and adverse effects associated with α2-adrenergic agonists and stimulant medication for initial ADHD medication treatment in preschool-age children

# Methods
- Retroscpetive EMR records review 
- 7 outpatient developmental-behavioral pediatric practices
- 2017-2019

# Important results
- Improvement profile 
	- Efficacy of both comparable [66% improved with α2-agnoist; 78% improved with stimulants]
- Side effect Profile 
	- Daytime sleepiness more common with α2-agnoist (38% v/s 3%)
	- Moodiness irritability, appetite supression and difficulty sleeping more common with Stimulants (50% v/s 29%, 38% v/s 7%, 21% v/s 11%)
	
# Conclusions 
- Differing side effects profile between medications 
- Efficacy comparision required further RCT

# Comment 
- α2-agnoist may be better to use considering the side effect profile
