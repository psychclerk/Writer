					**Treating a Friend**

First I have to acknowledge that this is a real dilemma.

Here are some options that can be offered as a cafeteria approach.

Option 1: Which you have already suggested, hear them out and help them connect with professional help.

However, this person does not want to see another  professional may be due to fear of being over-treated or being judged or losing confidentiality or gender bias.

Issues related to being over-treated can be addressed by reassuring that the friend can discuss the pharmacological mx with u before starting and if something seems off u can talk to the treating doctor to address any queries.

Stigma and confidentiality related worries may be allayed by offering help from someone away from the city via teleconsultation. Also reassuring that all doctors are professionals and while there could be a few black crows,
most of them are trustable and work within the limits of their professional boundaries which include right to respect, autonomy and confidentiality.

However, if the person is not convinced.

Option 2: You may agree to offer help with the following caveats: (based on observation of Dr. Anusha)

1. You will offer consultation within the limits of permissible practice. That is if they wish to available a consult, by telepsychiatry, they would have to read and understand the pros and cons of teleconsultation. And, Consent for the same.
2. To neutralize the previous relationship, you have to assert that the right to call a pt for in-person consult lies with the dr, based on complexity of the case. During the period of consultation and treatment u
will only maintain professional contact with the person as a patient.
3. You would also have the right to collateral informants if required. And, also the right to assert any issues that may be required; this must not be taken personally by the patient.
