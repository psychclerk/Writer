| Parameter | Baseline | 3 month | 6 month | Yearly | Response | Special drugs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CBC | X   |     |     | X   | Stop antipsychotic in ANC less than 1500 | Clozapine - FBC weekly for 3 months and every 2 weekly for 1 year and then monthly |
| Weight | X   | X   |     | X   | Offer lifestyle advise | Clozapine, Olanzapine |
| RBS | X   |     | X   | X   | Offer lifestyle advise, HbA1c | Clozapine, Olanzapine - at 1 month, then 6 monthly |
| Lipids | X   | X   |     | X   | Offer lifestyle advise, statin | Clozapine, Olanzapine;<br>Arip not clearly associated with dyslipidemia |
| BP  | X and during dose titration | X   | X   | X   | If severe hypotension observed (clozapine), slow rate of titration; <br>Switch to another antipsychotic if still remain symptomatic;<br>Treat HTN as per guidelines | Clozapine, Quetipaine and Chlorpromazine most likely to be associated with postural fall in BP |
| ECG | X and when target dose reached |     |     | X   | Refer to cardiologist is abnormalities detected | Haloperidol, pimozide, ziprazidone ECG mandatory |
| Urea, Electrolytes | X   |     |     | X   | Investigate any abnormalities detected | Amisulpride and sulpride renally excreted, consider reducing doses if GFR reduced |
| LFT | X   |     |     | X   | Hepatitis if transaminases x 3 normal <br><br>Functional damage if PT or albumin change <br><br>Stop suspect drugs | Clozapine, Chlorpromazine;<br><br>Amisulpride and sulpride are renally excreted hence LFT monitoring not required |
| Prolactin | X   |     | X   |     | If raised prolactin and symptomatic then switch drugs;<br><br>Do DEXA scan in pt with chronic prolactin elevation | Amisulpiride; Sulpiride, Risperidone, Paliperidone particularly associated with hyperprolactinemia<br><br>Arip, CLZ, QTP, OLZ do not elevate prolactin |
| CPK | X; Anytime if NMS suspected |     |     |     |     |     |
