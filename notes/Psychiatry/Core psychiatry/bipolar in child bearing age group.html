# Context
- Case of 28 y/o, married, female, with overweight status.
- At the time of first episode the patient was unmarried and had presented with euphoric mania, with family h/o of bipolar in brother and h/o good response to lithium in brother's case.
- 1st episode was treated with Lithium and pt showed good response. She was continued on Lithium prophylaxis for 2-3 years. She stopped taking same since 6 months after she got married and moved to UP with her spouse.
- 2nd episode since 15 days, hypomanic, ppt with psychosocial stressors.
- **Clinical question** is whether to start Lithium / another MS / MS  antipsychotic in this pt with active married life, UPT done today negative, but potential of bearing pregnancy in near future.

# Maudsley 13th ed review and case resolution
- We have to treat her as if a pregnant woman
- Risk of relapse during pregnancy if mood‐stabilizing medication is discontinued is high
- The risks of not stabilizing mood include:
	- harm to the mother through poor self‐care, lack of obstetric care or self‐harm
	- harm to the fetus or neonate (ranging from neglect to infanticide).

## Treatment with MS

### Lithium (Li)
- crosses the placenta
- Ebstein's anomaly in fetus
- Risk of malformations is overestimated
- NICE recommends that if lithium is considered essential in a woman planning pregnancy, the woman be informed of the risk of fetal malformations and the risk of toxicity in the baby if lithium is continued during breastfeeding.
- Hence, in this case **lithium was not recommended**

### Mood stabilizers (CBZ and VALP)
- Both CBZ and VALP have a clear causal link with increased risk of a variety of fetal abnormalities, particularly neural tube defects including spina bifida.
- NICE advises against the use of Valproate in pregnancy
- NICE advises discussing the possibility of stopping carbamazepine if a woman is planning a pregnancy or becomes pregnant
- Hence, in this case **Carbamazepine and Valproate were not recommended**

### MS (Lamotrigine)
- There is growing evidence that Lamotrigine is safer in pregnancy than carbamazepine or Valproate across a range of outcomes.
- However, clearance of Lamotrigine seems to increase radically during pregnancy and then reduces post partum so frequent Lamotrigine levels are necessary.
- This may become cumbersome if Lamotrigine has to be continued during pregnancy.
- Also, Lamotrigine does not have anti-manic potential, hence in this case **Lamotrigine was not recommended**

### Antipsychotic
- NICE recommends the **use of mood‐stabilizing antipsychotics as a preferable alternative** to continuation with a mood stabilizer.
- In acute mania in pregnancy use an antipsychotic and if this is ineffective consider ECT.
- NICE recommends **avoiding depot preparations and anticholinergic drugs** in pregnancy unless a depot is needed to keep a woman well through the perinatal period.
- CAVEATS - Be aware that drug‐induced hyperprolactinemia may prevent pregnancy. Consider switching to an alternative drug if hyperprolactinemia occurs and a pregnancy is planned.
- The most reproductive safety data are available for **quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone and haloperidol**, with more limited data for **clozapine, aripiprazole and ziprasidone**.
- Hence, in this case **olanzapine was recommended** with plan to later shift to Arip once acute phase is controlled considering overweight status

### Depressive episode
- In bipolar depression during pregnancy use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for moderate depression and an SSRI for more severe depression. Lamotrigine is also an option.
