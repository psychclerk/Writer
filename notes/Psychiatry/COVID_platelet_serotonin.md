# ARDS and Platelets

Prior studies suggest that in ARDS, platelets may exhibit a dysregulated state that exacerbates lung injury.

# COVID-19 and Platelets

Multiple groups have reported dramatically increased platelet activation, platelet reactivity, and platelet-leukocyte aggregates in COVID-19. In addition,
plasma from patients with severe COVID-19 increased the ex vivo activation of platelets and monocytes from healthy controls.

Patients with severe COVID-19 have been shown to harbor a higher degree of platelet activation and platelet-monocyte aggregation compared with patients
with COVID-19 that were not severe.

# COVID-19 ARDS compared with other etioligies

In a cohort of patients with H1N1-influenza infection with ARDS of equal severity, patients with COVID-19 ARDS displayed a 9 times higher burden of platelet-rich microthrombi in the alveolar capillaries.

Surrogate markers of in vivo platelet activation including plasma thromboxane B2, platelet factor 4, soluble CD40 ligand, and plasma serotonin were also significantly higher in COVID-19 patients relative to those in patients with ARDS of non-COVID-19 etiologies.

Autopsied patients with COVID-19 demonstrated an abundance of platelet-rich thrombi in the pulmonary and systemic microvasculature despite having received anticoagulation therapy.

**Based on above, platelet activation appears to play a central role in propagating the prothrombotic state encountered in COVID-19 in the lungs and
systemically, and this may account for recent high-quality evidence suggesting futility with the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in severe ICU cases of COVID-19.**

# COVID-19 and serotonin
Serotonin in one of the mediators released from activated platelets and 95% of the total body serotonin pool is stored within the platelet granules. A health pulmonary endothelium is required for clearance of released serotonin. This clearance may be hampered in SARS-COV-2 infection. May account for elevated plasma serotonin levels in COVID-19 patients, significanlty higher in comparision to ARDS patients of non-COVID etiologies. Plasma serotonin levels have been found to be directly proportional to disease severity.

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT), however, is a well-established mediator of pulmonary vascular tone and of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction mainly through 5HT2 receptors.

If driven by increased plasma serotonin, then effective 5HT-2 receptor antagonism (e.g. with cyproheptadine) may prove beneficial in the often challenging respiratory management of severe COVID-19.

# Bottom line
Pathologic platelet activation and platelet-mediator release in COVID-19 may be particularly effective targets for therapeutic intervention in this disease.
