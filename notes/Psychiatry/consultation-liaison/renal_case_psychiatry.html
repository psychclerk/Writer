# Case:
## 65 y/o, Referred for Altered Mental Status.

65 y/o, Female, Widow. Till last year pt was living by herself in Kerala after her spouses death. She is described by daughter as an active person running her own school. She has hypertension and diabetes since approx 15-20 years and has been under regular treatment. Family decided to move her from Kerala to Lucknow due to her health condition. While pt was visiting children in Lucknow on and off she reluctantly moved in with them in 2019. Pt was started on twice a week renal replacement therapy in March 2020 for CKD. She was reluctant to start CKD as her spouse had succumbed to renal illness after being on renal replacement therapy. She had been otherwise functional with no impairments in ADL and IADL, till recent illness that led to admission. Since Sept 2020 daughter noted that she had become less interactive and also lost desire for things that she used to enjoy earlier. With winters approaching family discussed with pt about shifting to Gujarat where one of her son stays. She had grown increasingly worried about this so that she would have episodes of pacing. The family took her to a psychiatrist who gave her a diagnosis of "anxiety" and started her on T. Escitalopram 10mg 1OD, T. Lorazepam 2mg 1HS and T. Clonazepam 0.25mg 1OD, about a month before presentation. With this line of treatment her pacing spells were reduced, but she still continued to be preoccupied with worry. She uneventfully traveled from Lucknow to Ahmadabad by flight. On the next day she grew impatient and restless. She was given the usual dosages of medications but by night she was unmanageable and was brought to trauma and emergency care.

On presentation she was tachypneic with SpO2 of 66%. Emergent management was done and she was admitted in the ICU. COVID or Atypical pneumonia was ruled out. Subsequently she was diagnosed with uremia with low sodium and high potassium. Renal replacement therapy was started for same.

2nd day into the admission pt became less interactive. A psychiatric reference was done. On examination pt was lying on cot with r/o psychomotor retardation, no restraints. She was awake. She was oriented to self, as she could tell her name when asked. She told she was in Kerala on questioning. She was not cooperative for rest of the examination making only grunting response to all questions asked. Affect was perplexed. An impression of possible delirium was made and psychotropic medications were omitted in admission.

However, with RRT she did not improve and her MSE was same on the 4th day of admission. With h/o night time worsening of symptoms. There was also h/o being uncooperative with taking pills, e.g. tightly clenching her teeth when asked to swallow pills. The pt was jointly seen with a neurologist who reported a non-focal neurological examination.

There is no h/o psychiatric illness in her younger days and no family h/o psychiatric illness.

The family members are anxious and query the psychiatrist whether she will improve or not?

# Answers
## Q. What is the Differential diagnosis?

A. The possible syndromic differentials in this case are 3D's - The 3 giants of geriatic psychiatry.

### Delirium, hypoactive
Acute onset (pt had good general functioning till shifting and AMS developed 2 days into admission), fluctuation (night time worsening) and Disorientation, possible etiological explanation (uremia with electrolyte derangement)

Onset - Hours to days
Mood - Fluctuate
Course - Acute, Fluctuating, responds to treatment
ADL- may be intact or impaired
IADL - may be intact or impaired

### Depression
While delirium is the most probable diagnosis, further evaluation for depression is required considering the recent h/o since Sept 2020. Noticed change in repertoire of interactions, the pacing behaviors could be part of anxiety or agitation seen in depression. The current presentation could also be due to Depression with catatonia in view of negativism (keeping teeth clenched when asked to take pills).

Onset - Weeks to months
Mood - Low/apathetic, Likely to be concerned about memory impairment
Course - Chronic, responds to treatment, no fluctuations
ADL - May neglect basic self care
IADL - May be intact or impaired

### Dementia
No H/o baseline cognitive dysfunction severe enough to impair ADL and IADL till admission. Hence less likely to be demented. However, dialysis dementia needs to be considered.

Onset - Months to years
Mood - Low or Fluctuates, Likely to hide cognitive impairment
Course - Chronic, deterioration over time
ADL -  May be intact early, impaired as the disease progresses
IADL - May be intact early, impaired before ADLS as the disease progresses

## Q. What are the possible ways in which Renal disease can contribute to psychiatric presentaion?
A. There are 3 main ways in which renal disease contributes to psychiatric presentation

1. Uremic encephalopathy and Dialysis related encephalopathy
2. Sodium dysregulation
3. Psychiatric complications of CKD

## Q. What is uremic encephalopathy?
A. Renal injury and uremia can induce various neuropsychiatric conditions, often based on the severity of kidney impairment.

Severity is defined based on GFR

Mild uremia - Poor concentration
Moderate uremia - Encephalopathy
Severe uremia - Myoclonus, Astrexis, Seizures and Coma

Serum labs typically reveal elevations in BUN and creatinine, along with electrolyte disturbances such as hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. While head imaging may be undertaken to evaluate for other potential contributors to encephalopathy, it rarely confirms uremic contributions to delirium.

## Q. What is dialysis related encephalopathy?
A. Encephalopathy may complicate the period during and shortly after dialysis typically hours), likely related to rapid osmolar and electrolyte shifts and neuronal swelling. This syndrome may be prevented by slowing the course of dialysis and monitoring electrolyte shifts.

Dialysis dementia is a unique neurologic complication of renal failure associated with chronic dialysis. While many questions remain about the pathophysiology of the disease, aluminum toxicity is probably the major factor in the pathogenesis of the dementia. Reducing dialysate aluminum levels and minimizing oral aluminum intake has markedly decreased the incidence of the disease. This diagnosis is now not seen due to better technology that prevents aluminum toxicity.

However, recent research suggest that older patients are at a high risk for developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease after initiation of hemodialysis, according to new research appearing in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018).

## Q. Would EEG be of any help in this patient?
A. Role of Bedside EEG in Diagnosis of delirium

"To examine the association of electroencephalogram (EEG) findings with delirium, researchers prospectively enrolled 200 nonintubated patients without dementia over 17 months at one tertiary-care academic medical center who were referred for EEG evaluation of altered mental status. Patients from all wards and intensive care units were included. Analyses focused on associations of routine EEG features with validated measures of the presence and severity of delirium, length of hospital stay, and Glasgow Outcome Scale score at discharge. Multivariate analyses accounted for age, sex, and comorbidities including admission diagnoses.

Of the 200 patients, 60.5% had delirium. Several EEG findings were highly specific for the diagnosis of delirium, including periodic discharges, triphasic waves, lateralized rhythmic delta, and “low voltage/generalized attenuation.” These findings, however, were rare and had very low sensitivity. By contrast, presence of either theta or delta GENERALIZED SLOWING was SENSITIVE and correlated strongly with delirium severity regardless of arousal state (hyper- or hypoactive) and comorbidities. Generalized EEG slowing was highly specific for mortality; no patient without EEG slowing (even those with delirium) died in the hospital."

Ref https://www.jwatch.org/na50468/2019/12/26/eeg-slowing-and-delirium

Uremia-related encephalopathy is frequently associated with generalized slowing on EEG, with triphasic wave patterns in some cases.

An EEG in this case would help confirm the diagnostic suspicion of delirium due to uremia. It may also help in giving some solace to the anxious relatives, as their anxious queries suggest they may be skeptical about current management.

Neurophysician has advised for MRI Brain and EEG.

## Q. Sodium dysregulation and psychiatric manifestations?
A.
### HYPONATREMIA
Clinically significant decline in serum sodium (normal range: 135–145 mEq/L), or rapid shifts in plasma sodium levels, can precipitate various neuropsychiatric and physical change.

Mild-Moderate : Fatigue, Headache, Blurred vision, Nausea, Reduced appetite, Insomnia

Severe : Delirium, Seizures, Coma, Death

Development of symptoms depend on the speed of decline of Na+ concentration.

Hyponatremia can be precipitated by a number of conditions (e.g., burns, gastrointestinal fluid losses); the consultation psychiatrist is most frequently presented with questions around two conditions
1. SIADH - apart from the various medical causes of SIADH, SSRIs, SNRIs, Antipsychotics, and Anticonvulsants (Carb/Oxacarb) can cause SIADH. This pt was started on SSRIs one month before admission. And, pt had a serum sodium of 126 on 1st day of admission. Serum and Urine Osm. were not done on presentation, probably as the low Na was explained by uremia in a pt with CKD. However I feel it should have been done.

2. Primary polydipsia - is usually a psychiatric factor contributing to renal disease. History for increased water drinking was not reported.

### HYPERNATREMIA
Elevations in serum sodium are most often symptomatic when they occur abruptly or severely (e.g., Na > 155 mEq/L).

Mild-Mod : Acute Confusion, Somnolence, Myalgia, Myoclonus
Severe: Seizures, Coma, Death

Hypernatremia may result from excessive sodium intake (e.g., excess hypertonic saline hydration) or dehydration without compensatory water intake. Hypernatremia may also occur in the context of pathologic processes that interfere with ADH.

Long-term use of lithium, for example, can decrease sensitivity of the renal collecting ducts to the activity of ADH, thereby precipitating nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI). Nephrogenic DI may be treated with thiazide diuretics; if the decision is made to continue lithium use, the addition of a thiazide will often require a reduction in lithium dosing to compensate for the diuretic’s interference with lithium clearance. Central DI may prompt administration of synthetic ADH, in the form of desmopressin (DDAVP).

## Q. What are the Psychiatric complications of CKD and need for dialysis?
A. As with other potentially debilitating conditions, chronic kidney disease—particularly when dialysis is necessary—is commonly complicated by depression and anxiety.
The process of hemodialysis, itself, may trigger significant anxiety with recurrent hospital visits, phlebotomy, and rapid electrolyte changes that can induce physical discomfort.
Existential fears over the reliance of technology to maintain vitality may manifest with helplessness. In this context, dialysis-dependent patients may question their desire to continue this degree of care, and therefore struggle with adherence.

### Q. What are the possible ways in which Psychiatric conditions can contribute to renal disease?
### SIADH

Of psychotropic medications, SSRIs are among the most heavily studied contributors to hyponatremia by SIADH.

Advanced age is a particularly notable risk factor; 10%–25% of patients over the age of 65 experience some degree of hyponatremia after starting an SSRI, often within two weeks of initiation, and the condition is believed to be dose-independent. Detection hinges on obtaining a serum sodium level before starting a potentially offending agent and repeating in the first weeks of use.

SIADH can be diagnosed by comparing osmolality and sodium concentrations in the serum and urine; typically, with SIADH, urine osmolality (Uosm > 100 mOsm/kg) and sodium (UNa > 40 mEq/L) are elevated in spite of low serum sodium and osmolality (Posm < 275 mOsm/kg). The concurrent presence of polydipsia or other conditions that interfere with free water or sodium excretion may complicate the definitive diagnosis of SIADH based on lab studies.

### Primary polydipsia
Affects 6-20% psychiatric patients, most notably psychotic patients. Hyponatremia is commonly observed, and is typically marked by low urine and serum osmolality.
