- Community mental health service in India in infancy
- Mainly urban based 
- Exception DMHP
- SCARF is running community outreach program SCARF TElepsychiatry, TN since 2010
- In this program, with the help of CLWs, persons with mental health disorders were identified from the community and treatment initiated through telepsychiatry. (Similar to our SPARSH extension program)
- Three community project coordinators and six community-level mental health workers were individually interviewed using a semi-structured proforma to understand the challenges faced by them in delivering mental health services to the people in the community.

- Wider coordinated effect from different sectors such as governmental departments, nongovernmental organizations, and general public and leveraging technology could facilitate the activities of community-level workers
- It is imperative to bring changes at the policy level in implementing mental health services at the community level
