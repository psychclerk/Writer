                           **Antipsychotic prophylaxis**

<img src="../../attachments/reb-tail.jpg" border=0>

CAVEAT - before reading and interpreting the following data, be mindful of the following:

- It should be noted that definitions of relapse usually focus on the severity of positive symptoms, and largely ignore cognitive and negative symptoms: positive symptoms are more likely to lead to hospitalization while cognitive and negative symptoms (which respond less well, and in some circumstances may even be exacerbated by antipsychotic treatment) have a greater overall impact on quality of life. 
- Lack of relapse is not the same as good functioning

# First episode psychosis

**Q. What is the reduction in relapse rate with antipsychotics?**

A. 26% of first-episode patients randomized to receive maintenance antipsychotics relapsed after 6–12 months compared with 61% randomized to receive placebo. (_Leucht et al. Lancet 2012;379:2063–2071_)

**Q. What happens after withdrawal of antipsychotics as per concensus in FEP?**

A. Withdrawing antipsychotic treatment in line with this consensus led to a relapse rate of almost 80% after 1 year  medication‐free and 98% after 2 years. (_Gitlin et al. Am J Psychiatry 2001;158:1835–1842._)

**Q. Does continuation of antipsychotics in FEP offer any advantage?**

A. 5-year follow-up of a 2-year RCT, during which patients received either maintenance antipsychotic treatment or had their antipsychotic dose reduced or discontinued completely, found that while there was a clear advantage for maintenance treatment with respect to reducing short‐term relapse this advantage was lost in the medium term. Further, the dose-reduction/discontinuation group were receiving lower doses of antipsychotic drugs at follow‐up and had better functional outcomes. (_Wunderink et al. JAMA Psychiatry 2013;70:913–920_)

**Q. How many percentage of patients do not need long term prophylaxis after FEP?**

A. 18–30%. (_Murray et al. Br J Psychiatry 2016;209:361–365_)

**Q. Are there any predictors of discontinuation of antipsychotics after FEP maintenance?**

A. No reliable predictors.

**Q. What is the current practice?**

- After 1 year of maintenance treatment, patients should have their **dose reduced gradually** and all relevant family members and health‐care staff should be aware of the discontinuation.
- It is vital that patients, carers and key‐workers are **aware of the early signs of relapse** and how to access help.
- Antipsychotics should not be considered the only intervention. Evidence based **psychosocial and psychological interventions** are clearly also important.

# Multi-episode schizophrenia

**Q. Who is most likely to relapse?**

A. Patients with residual symptoms, a greater adverse‐effect burden and a less positive attitude to treatment are at greater risk of relapse. (_Schennach et al. Psychiatr Serv 2012;63:87–90_)

**Q. What is the evidence-base for relapse prevention with antipsychotics in schizophrenia?**

- Antipsychotic drugs, when taken regularly, **protect against relapse** in the short, medium and (with less certainty) long term. (_Leucht et al. Lancet 2012;379:2063–2071_, _Almerie et al. Schizophr Bull 2008;34:13–14_)
- Those who receive targeted antipsychotics (i.e. only when symptoms re‐emerge) seem to have a worse outcome than those who receive **prophylactic antipsychotics**. (_Jolley et al. Br Med J 1990;301:837–842_, _Herz et al. Arch Gen Psychiatry 1991; 48:333–339_)
- Low-dose antipsychotics are less effective than **standard doses**. (_Schooler et al. Arch Gen Psychiatry 1997;54:453–463_)
  - Lower doses of the older drugs (8 mg haloperidol/day or equivalent) are, when compared with higher doses, associated with less severe adverse effects, better subjective state and better community adjustment. Very low doses increase the risk of psychotic relapse.
  - There are no data to support the use of lower than standard doses of the newer drugs as prophylaxis. Doses that are acutely effective should generally be continued as prophylaxis. An exception to this is prophylaxis after a first episode where very careful dose reduction is supportable.
- Meta‐analyses of clinical trials have shown that the relative and absolute risks of relapse with **depot maintenance treatment** were 30% and 10% lower, compared to oral treatment. (_Leucht et al. Lancet 2012;379:2063–2071_, _Leucht et al. Schizophr Res 2011;127:83–92_)
- A large meta‐analysis concluded that the **risk of relapse with newer antipsychotics is similar to that associated with older drugs**. (_Leucht et al. Lancet 2012;379:2063–2071_)

**Q.What is the data on attrition rates in long term antipsychotic prophylaxis?**

A. CATIE and SOHO trial data shows that attrition rate
from olanzapine was lower than the attrition rate from other antipsychotic drugs, suggesting that olanzapine may be more effective than other antipsychotic drugs (except clozapine). However, prescribing choice should be based on potential risk–benefit and it should be noted that olanzapine is associated with a high propensity for metabolic adverse effects. (_Lieberman et al. N Engl J Med 2005;353:1209–1223_, _Ciudad et al. Eur Psychiatry 2008; 23:1–7_)

**Q. What is the data on adherence to antipsychotic treatment?**
A. Non-compliance with long-term antipsychotic treatment is very high. An estimated 40 to 50 percent of patients become non-compliant within 1 or 2 years. (_Kaplan Synopsis 11e_)

**Q. How and when to stop antipsychotic treatment?**

- Before discontinuation consider the following:
  - Is the patient symptom‐free, and, if so, for how long? (excluding long-standing, non-distressing symptoms)
  - What is the severity of adverse effects (EPS, TD, sedation, obesity, etc.)?
  - What was the previous pattern of illness? Consider the speed of onset, duration and severity of episodes and any danger posed to self and others.
  - Has dosage reduction been attempted before, and, if so, what was the outcome?
  - What are the patient’s current social circumstances? Is it a period of relative stability, or are stressful life events anticipated?
  - What is the social cost of relapse (e.g. is the patient the sole breadwinner for a family)?
  - Is the patient/carer able to monitor symptoms, and, if so, will they seek help?
- Those with a history of aggressive behaviour or serious suicide attempts and those with residual psychotic symptoms should be considered for life‐long treatment.
- If a decision to discontinue has been made, then patients, carers and key‐workers should be aware of the early signs of relapse and how to access help. And, dose reduction should be gradual.

**Q. Key points that patients should know about rx with antipsychotics?**

- Antipsychotics do not ‘cure’ schizophrenia. They treat symptoms in the same way that insulin treats diabetes.
- Some antipsychotic drugs may be more effective than others.
- Many antipsychotic drugs are available. Different drugs suit different patients.
- Perceived adverse effects should always be discussed, so that the best tolerated drug can be found.
- Long‐term treatment is generally required to prevent relapses.
- Antipsychotics should never be stopped suddenly.
- Psychological and psychosocial interventions increase the chance of staying well.
