# General principles of prescribing antipsychotics
- Titrate the dose to the **lowest effective dose**. After achieving minimum effective dose **wait for 2 weeks**. Increase dose after 2 weeks if the patient is clearly showing no response. (There is gathering evidence that lack of response at 2 weeks is a potent predictor of later poor outcome, unless dose or drug is changed).
- Use of **single antipsychotic** is recommended. See note on [combination of antipsychotics](https://psychclerk.github.io/Writer/notes/Psychiatry/Antipsychotic_combinations.md.html). 
- Antipsychotics should not be used as PRN sedatives 
- Responses to antipsychotic drug treatment should be assessed by recognized rating scales
- Regular cardiac and metabolic monitoring
- With LAI, plasma levels continue to increase at least 6â€“12 weeks after initiation, even without a change in dose. Dose increases during this time are therefore difficult to evaluate. The preferred method is to establish efficacy and tolerability of oral medication at a particular dose and then give the equivalent dose of that drug in LAI form.
