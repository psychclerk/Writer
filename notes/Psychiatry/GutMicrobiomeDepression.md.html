# Background 
- Gut microbiome disturbances have been implicated in major depressive disorder
- However, little is known about how the gut virome, microbiome, and fecal metabolome change, and how they interact in MDD

# Methods
- Using whole-genome shotgun metagenomic and untargeted metabolomic methods, we identified 3 bacteriophages, 47 bacterial species, and 50 fecal metabolites showing notable differences in abundance between MDD patients and healthy controls (HCs)

# Results 
- Patients with MDD were mainly characterized by increased abundance of the genus Bacteroides and decreased abundance of the genera Blautia and Eubacterium
- Disturbed microbial genes and fecal metabolites were consistently mapped to amino acid (Î³-aminobutyrate, phenylalanine, and tryptophan) metabolism
- A combinatorial marker panel that robustly discriminated MDD from HC individuals in both the discovery and validation sets

# Conclusion
- Role of disturbed gut ecosystem in MDD
