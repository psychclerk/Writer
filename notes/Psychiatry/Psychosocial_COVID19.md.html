# Introduction
- First case reported in China in December 2019
- COVID-19 declared public health emergency on 30th January 2020
- Ensuing lockdowns and home confinement
- First and foremost response has been fear and sense of clear and imminent danger

# How stress gets under our skin?

## Stress
- Whether of not it feels “stressful”
- Non-specific response of the body to any demand

## Stressor
- Any stimulus that gives rise to stress response
- Psychosocial – by virtue of cognitive interpretation; (real or imagined)
- Biogenic – inherent stimulus

## Working definition
- Stressor -> Stress = physiological response which act as a mediating link -> target organ damage
- Stress is not all negative

## Physiological substrate for stress response
- Neuron
- Neurotransmitters
- Neural impulse
- CNS
	- Brain
	- Spinal cord
- PNS
	- Somatic – Muscles
- ANS
	- SNS – Arousal
	- PNS – Relaxation
- Endocrine
	- HPA Axis

## Systems model of stress response
- Current evidence suggests existence of highly specific neuroendocrine and endocrine efferent mechanisms

<p align="center">
  <img width="460" height="300" style="padding:1px;border:thin solid black;" src="https://media.springernature.com/original/springer-static/image/chp%3A10.1007%2F978-1-4939-9098-6_2/MediaObjects/215187_4_En_2_Fig7_HTML.png"></br>

### Cognitive appraisal and affective integration
- Epictetus – “Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them.”
- Likewise, “Stressors, like beauty lies in the eye of the beholder.”
- Cognitive appraisal refers to the process of cognitive interpretation, that is, the meanings that we assign to the world as it unfolds before us. (forebrain)
- Affective integration refers to the blending and coloring of felt emotion into the cognitive interpretation. (limbic)
- The resultant cognitive–affective complex represents how the stressors are ultimately perceived.
- In effect, this critical integrated perception represents the determination of whether psychosocial stimuli become psychosocial stressors or not.
- Vulnerable to
  - Biological predispositions
	- Personality patterns
	- Learned behaviors
	- Coping resources

### Neurological triggering mechanisms
- Locus ceruleus
- Limbic nuclei
- Hypothalamus

### Stress response per se

#### Neural response (quick and short lived)
- SNS -> arousal via norepinephrine
- PNS -> relaxation via acetylcholine
- Somatic

#### Neuroendocrine response (intermediate)
- Fight or flight = Mobilization of muscle to respond
- Via release of catecholamines in blood from adrenal medulla (similar to neural response but with 20-30 second delay)

#### Endocrine response (chronic and prolonged)
- Activated when active coping not possible
- Passive coping
- Mainly HPA axis -> corticosteroids from adrenal cortex -> GAS

  Figure 3: HPA Axis
</p>

#### General adaptation syndrome

<p align="center">
  <img width="460" height="300" style="padding:1px;border:thin solid black;" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-hmhco-vmg-craftcms-public/_cliffsnotes/assets/25289.jpg"></br>
  Figure 4: Phases of the General Adapdation Syndrome
</p>

- Alarm phase : Body resources are mobilized -> acute target organ damage may occur
- Resistance stage : Body fights to reestablish and maintain homeostasis. -> target organ adaptation may bring about changes in the organ. Stages 1 and 2 can be repeated throughout one’s life in response to stressful situations.
- Exhaustion stage : Resources are depleted -> target organ damage likely to occur

### Target organ activation

<p align="center">
  <img width="460" height="300" style="padding:1px;border:thin solid black;" src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bruce-Mcewen-2/publication/6223301/figure/fig1/AS:667176419733521@1536078662833/Central-role-of-the-brain-in-allostasis-and-the-behavioral-and-physiological-response-to.jpg"></br>
  Figure 5: Brain as the target organ of stress
</p>

- **Allostasis** is the active process that anticipates, predicts and promotes adaptation
- **Allostatic load** : The same mediators that allow use to adapt also cause damage when overuse or out of balance.

<p align="center">
  <img width="460" height="300" style="padding:1px;border:thin solid black;" src="https://qphs.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-304effc91c3bd0c1bc68e1db0d86e724"></br>
  Figure 6: Concept of allostatic load
</p>

- Acute release of cortisol is helpful - stage 1
- Chronic release of cortical is unhelpful - stage 3
- More than cortisol / non-linear processes
- Re-modelling of architecture

  <img width="460" height="300" style="padding:1px;border:thin solid black;" src="https://www.child-encyclopedia.com/sites/default/files/images/contenu/Figure-1-Non-linear-network-of-mediators-in-the-stress-response.png"></br>
  Figure 7: Non-linear nature of downstream stress effects
</p>

### Coping
- Coping may be thought of as environmental or cognitive tactics designed to attenuate the stress response.
- Adaptive coping strategies reduce stress while at the same time promoting long-term health (e.g., exercise, relaxation, proper nutrition, seeking support).
- Maladaptive coping strategies, on the other hand, do indeed reduce stress in the short term but serve to erode health in the long term (alcohol/drug abuse, cigarette smoking, interpersonal withdrawal).
- When coping is successful, extraordinary target organ activation is reduced or eliminated and homeostasis is reestablished.

# ✨Impact on HCW

## Indian Data
[ Indian J Psychiatry 2021;63:222-7](https://www.indianjpsychiatry.org/text.asp?2021/63/3/222/318709) Access date 18/06/21

**CAVEAT**: Data from this survey is limited due to being Open ended survey and therefore lack of being able to calculate response rate. A sample size of only 303, considering that the survey was shared with various hospitals across India. Generalizability of the findings to general HCW population may be limited.

- online survey using Survey Monkey® platform
- PHQ-9, GAD-7 and a self designed questionnaire
- 303 participants with a mean age of 41.2
- 69% male
- 79.9% married
- 46.2% of the participants had either anxiety disorder or depression
- Higher level of anxiety and depression scores were associated with being
    - female
    - having undergone quarantine
    - directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients
    - younger age (<30 years)
    
# Impact on COVID-19 positive patients and quarantined individuals

## Stigma

### Immediate effects
- Delay in seeking care
- Hiding of important information like travel history
- Increased risk of community transmission
- Attacks on informers
	- Bihar man beaten to death for informing arrival of 2 people from Maharashtra [TOI 31 March 2020]

### Delayed effects
- May continue even years after exposure
- Making it difficult for many to restart
- Stoke fears of discrimination and marginalization

## Home quarantined patient
- Inadequate of confusing information can lead to confusion and anxiety
- Fear of infection or infecting others
- Minor physical symptoms may be mis-interpreted as symptoms of illness
- Frustration and Boredom
- Financial Loss
- Unavailability of supplies

## Hospital quarantined patient

### Psychosocial factors predicting hospitalization

- **Batty et al. [Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915912031309X)**
	- Sample taken from UK Biobank [ a large-scale community-based cohort]
	- 908 hospitalizations for COVID-19 out of 431,051 study members
	- several factors found to be associated with risk of admission
		- low education
		- low income
		- occupation
		- **psychological distress**
		- **past psychiatric history**
		- **neurotic personality traits**
		- **low cognitive performance** [**Most Robust association**]

### Isolation in a hospital leads to

- Loss of personal freedom
- Loss of control
- Loss of social contact / alienation
- Exposure to unfamiliar environment
- Loss of daily routine
- Dependence on others
- Exposure to an uncertain situation

  - Don't philosophize, moralize, preach or impose your own religion

## Psychopharmacology

### Treatment

#### Challenges
- Interactions with COVID-19 medications
  - Antivirals (Remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir)
  - Antibiotics (Azithromycin)
  - Immunomodulators (Steroids, interferon-B)
  - Bronchodilators
  - Anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretics
- Adverse effects
- Co-morbid medical conditions

#### Continuing psychotropic medications of a patients with pre-existing psychiatric illness

- Dhillon et al. **[Ann Indian Psychiatry 2020.](https://www.anip.co.in/text.asp?2020/4/2/226/301441)** and Mental Health Challenges During
COVID-19 Pandemic Guidance for Psychiatrists [NIMHANS, 2020]

- Most psychiatric illness require long-term prophylaxis of psychotropics, which may have to be continued even after remission of symptoms to prevent relapse. Precautions for commonly used psychotropic agents in the context of COVID-19 are discussed below:

##### Antipsychotics

- Increase QTc [Along with other medications that can increase QTc such as Azithromycin, HCQ, antivirals]
  - Haloperidol
  - Quetiapine
  - Use with ECG monitoring
- Safer alternatives are
  - Aripiprazole
  - Olanzapine
  - Risperidone
- Antivirals are CYP inhibitors and hence increase the levels of haloperidol, risperidone, aripiprazole and quetiapine
  - Reduce the dosage
  - CAUTION when using clozapine, Bupropion

##### Antidepressants

- Increase Qtc
  - Citalopram
  -  TCAs
  - Mirtazapine
- Two way interactions b/w some SSRI and Antivirals
	- Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and bupropion are CYP enzyme inhibitors -> alter antiviral levels
	- Antivirals -> CYP interactions -> increase SSRI levels -> serotonin syndrome
	- reduce dosage of these psychotropics
- Safer alternatives
	- Escitalopram
	- Sertraline

##### Mood stabilizers

- Lithium
	- renally excreted -> least interactions with antivirals
	- but low therapeutic index - toxicity can be ppt with
  	- NSAIDs
  	- Dehydration
  	- Renal failure
  	- Hyponatremia
  	- use with caution
- Valproate is generally safe with antivirals
  - dose adjustment may be required

##### Sedative / Hypnotics

- Risk of respiratory depression
- longer acting benzodiazepines like diazepam or clonazepam may be avoided.
- Lorazepam is preferred as it has the least interaction with antiviral drugs and shorter acting.

#### Acute onset behavioral symptoms in those receiving treatment/prophylaxis for COVID-19

##### Delirium
- Woolley [Geriatric Nursing 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079024/#__ffn_sectitle), Dhillon et al. **[Ann Indian Psychiatry 2020](https://www.anip.co.in/text.asp?2020/4/2/226/301441)**

- Sleep cycle
  1. Melatonin
   - melatonin 3mg PO (per oral) QHS (at hour of sleep)
   - useful in prevention of delirium
   - also has immunomodulatory property
  2. Trazodone can also be used for sleep regulation as monotherapy
  3. Benzodiazepines
   - Should be avoided except in cases of delirium tremens
   - Risk of respiratory depression

- Agitation/Disruptive behaviors

  A. Verbal de-escalation
    1. How to approach?
        - ensure privacy
        - ensure personal safety
        - approach as a team
    2. What to say?
        - stay calm and listen
        - talk in soft and firm tone
        - do not provocate
        - do not judge
        - try to understand the concern
        - offer valid solutions

  B. Chemical restraint
    1. Haloperidol
       - a dose of 2.5–5 mg can be used orally or intramuscularly.
       - Monitor QTc when used along with other QTc prolonging meds or when given IV
       - IV dose of haloperidol is **2-4 times less** that oral or IM because first pass metabolism is being by-passed
       - maximum daily dose of IM/oral haloperidol to less than or equal to 15 mg/day. [lesser in elderly]
       - wait for at least 45 minutes before repeat dose
    2. Olanzapine, 2.5-5mg QHS, can also be given orally
    3. Quetiapine (25–50 mg) can be given orally, especially in pt with FTD, DLB or movement disorder, due to lower risk of EPSE.
    4. In the ICU setting - Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 agonist and reduces the release of noradrenaline and helps curtailing restlessness.
    5. In the ward setting, Clonidine can also be used for the same reason. Clonidine 0.1mg BD or TID. It can also be used as a skin patch.
    6. Valproic acid can be considered as an adjunctive agent for hyperactive or mixed-type delirium, particularly for those with prolonged QT, those with severe movement disorder concerns, or those who experience side effects of anti-psychotics such as akathisia.
    7. In extreme cases not responding to the above measures, only short-acting low-dose oral benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam 1 to 2 mg) may be considered with close monitoring for respiratory distress and respiratory failure.

  C. Mechanical restraint
     Mechanical restraint should be used for minimum possible time, till chemical restraints start working.

##### Psychosis / Mania
- Standard antimanic/antipsychotic treatment like risperidone or olanzapine can be given, mindful of the drug interactions.
- Mood stabilizers can also prescribed in patients with bipolar disorder based on clinical need, with the precautions.
- Catatonic symptoms can be treated with intravenous/oral lorazepam. But, use with caution due to risk of respiratory suppression.
- Parenteral haloperidol 5-10mg can be used alone or in combination with promethazine (only through intramuscular route) in severe states of agitation as a chemical restraint.

##### Depression, Anxiety and Insomnia
- Escitalopram
- Sertraline
- Caution for Hyponatremia in the elderly
- Low dose benzodiazepine preferably a short acting drug like lorazepam orally or parenterally can be helpful in acute management.
- Zolpidem (2.5-5mg) is relatively safer in terms of respiratory functioning.

### ✨ Grief management in COVID-19
[Indian J Psychiatry 2021;63:211](https://www.indianjpsychiatry.org/text.asp?2021/63/3/211/318728) Access date 18/06/21

- **Grief**: The perception of death followed by the gradual “sinking in” of its consequences leads to psychobiological reaction.
- Unmanaged grief can have serious consequences.
- **Death rituals** have a therapeutic function wherein they allow a family and a group to mourn in a ritualistic way. This allows people to share grief and keep the deceased as focus of attention for a fixed time and then to move on with life.
- Sometimes, this process is hampered by what Kenneth Doka called **“disenfranchised grief”**.
- COVID-19 has unexpectedly disturbed the process of death rituals as it leads to:
  1. Unexpected or sudden loss
  2. Depletion of emotional and coping resources
  3. Limitation in visiting and end of care support
  4. Not able to perform last rituals
  5. Lack of social support due to COVID restrictions
- The mechanical and impersonal process has led to severe psychological trauma in the survivors. **So, what should be the model of care for these people?**
  1. We should try to increase the sharing of grief and the handling of the person should be allowed to take place
  2. The physical support and the economical support have to be arranged, particularly where both parents have died
  3. There are some common modes like “condolence meetings” or “smaran sabha” (may be in online mode) which should be attended by both family members and colleagues.
  
### Does psychiatry have anything to offer in terms of COVID-19 management per se?

#### Hamed et al [Medical Hypothesis 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7382922/), Pashaei [J Clin Neuroscience 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096758682100120X).

- Inflammatory cytokines -> organ damage
- 5-HT has been found to regulate innate and adaptive immune responses
- Increase cytokine levels -> reduce serotonin -> by increasing metabolism of tryptophan through IDO activation

### Lenze et al [JAMA 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2773108)

- Fluvoxamine - SSRI and sigma receptor agonist
- RCT 152 adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 and symptom onset within 7 days
- Clinical deterioration occurred in 0 patients treated with fluvoxamine vs 6 (8.3%) patients treated with placebo over 15 days, a difference that was statistically significant
- adult outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19 treated with fluvoxamine, compared with placebo, had a lower likelihood of clinical deterioration over 15 days

### Hortel el al [Molecular Psychiatry 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01021-4)
- Observational multicenter retrospective cohort study [PARIS]
- Primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death
- Of 7230 adults hospitalized for COVID-19, 345 patients (4.8%) received an antidepressant within 48h of hospital admission.
- Compared endpoint between patients who received antidepressants and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics, clinical and biological markers of disease severity, and other psychotropic medications
- Significant association between antidepressant use and reduced risk of intubation or death (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43–0.73, p < 0.001).
- Association was also significant for SSRI and non-SSRI antidepressants, and for fluoxetine, paroxetine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine (all p < 0.05).

### Bottom-line
- Sertraline has both σ-1 agonism and an SSRI, also cardiac safe and low risk of drug-drug interactions
- Further double blind RCTs are required
