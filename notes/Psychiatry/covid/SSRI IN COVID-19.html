# The possible immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in coronavirus disease patients

## Hamed et al Medical Hypothesis 2020

### Immune dysregulation in COVID-19
- is a consequence of elevation of cortisol, the stress hormone, and reduction of serotonin
- Stressful conditions associated with infection had shown to cause an elevation in the levels of the inflammatory mediator IL-6 that causes a decrease in the number and activity of cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells
- Elevated inflammatory cytokines have been shown to precipitate inflammations in many organs especially lung which is a serious condition and a main cause of mortality in COVID-19

### 5-HT and immnunity
- 5-HT has been found to regulate innate and adaptive immune responses
- Elevated cytokine levels have been shown to increase the rate of metabolism of serotonin due to activation of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme that metabolizes tryptophan which is the precursor of serotonin

### Hypothesis
- Antidepressants are found to augment the immune system response through inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors, in particular CRP, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6
- SSRIs increase serotonin via proscribing its reuptake into the presynaptic cell then increasing the level of serotonin inside the synaptic cleft to bind the postsynaptic receptor
- This class had been proved to prevent the elevation of cytokine levels which causes depression
- In vitro antibacterial effect and modulation of antibiotic activity were also associated with using SSRIs

  Figure: Drug repurposing of SSRIs
</p>

- **In COVID-19 patients, SSRIs may help in hindering cytokine release syndrome that is responsible for aggravating sickness progression and the subsequent increase in TNFα**
- SSRIs also have anti-coagulant properties

### Which SSRI is suited?
- **Sertraline** wide therapeutic index
- low anticholinergic t/f good for elderly and cardiac
- shown to regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines
augment action of antibiotics against S. Aureus, E. Coli and P. Aeruginosa
- reduced influenza-induced lung inflammation when combined with oseltamivir in mouse model

# Fluvoxamine vs Placebo and Clinical Deterioration in Outpatients With Symptomatic COVID-19 - A Randomized Clinical Trial

## Lenze et al JAMA 2020
- Question: Does fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and σ-1 receptor agonist, prevent clinical deterioration in outpatients with acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?
- Findings: In this randomized trial that included 152 adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 and symptom onset within 7 days, clinical deterioration occurred in 0 patients treated with fluvoxamine vs 6 (8.3%) patients treated with placebo over 15 days, a difference that was statistically significant.
- Meaning: In this preliminary study, adult outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19 treated with fluvoxamine, compared with placebo, had a lower likelihood of clinical deterioration over 15 days; however, determination of clinical efficacy would require larger randomized trials with more definitive outcome measures.

# Association between antidepressant use and reduced risk of intubation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: results from an observational study

## Hortel el al Molecular Psychiatry 2021
- prior meta-analysis showed that antidepressant use in major depressive disorder was associated with reduced plasma levels of several pro-inflammatory mediators
- antidepressants may inhibit acid sphingomyelinase activity, which may prevent the infection of epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2
- Observational multicenter retrospective cohort study [PARIS]
- Primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death
- Of 7230 adults hospitalized for COVID-19, 345 patients (4.8%) received an antidepressant within 48 h of hospital admission.
- Compared endpoint between patients who received antidepressants and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics, clinical and biological markers of disease severity, and other psychotropic medications
- Significant association between antidepressant use and reduced risk of intubation or death (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43–0.73, p < 0.001).
- Association was also significant for SSRI and non-SSRI antidepressants, and for fluoxetine, paroxetine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine (all p < 0.05).

# Bottom line
- Cytokines increase tryptophan metabolism (serotonin precursor) by increasing IDO enzyme activity
- Single RCT of Fluvoxamine an SSRI and σ-1 receptor agonist shown promise
- Observational study of those already on antidepressants, association with reduced intubation or death
- Possible MOA
   - Inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase activity -> prevent further infection
   - Reduced plasma proinflammatory cytokines
- Sertraline has both σ-1 agonism and an SSRI, also cardiac safe and low risk of drug-srug ineractions [OFF-LABEL USE??? ON CASE TO CASE BASIS; USE FOR RX OF COMORBID ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WHRERE CLINCALLY INDICATED]
- speculated ideal time to start once respiratory symptom begin to be worse (i.e. before the onset of acute lung injury)
- Navin et al have raised concerns about potential risks with SSRI in SARS-COV2, such as impaired coagulation, risk of arrhythmias, liver injury, and cytochrome-mediated drug interactions, which can potentially limit the use of SSRI in such patients
- Further double blind RCTs are required
