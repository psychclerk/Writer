# New drug development for COVID 19 - Challenges 

Dr. Barna Ganguly, Prof. of Pharmacology, Pramukhswami Medical College, Bhaikaka University, Karamsad

## Drug development process 
- Arduous 
- Expensive (2 billion USD for 1 drug)
- Takes 9 years from bench to patient 

## Current scenario COIVD-19 psychopharmacology
- Pipeline of drugs used 
  - **Favilavir** - disapproved UDFDA
  - **CHQ and HCQ** - no more used at prevent, frequent side effects 
  - **Remdesivir** - originally designed to target ebola, showed efficacy against SARS-Cov and Mers-COV, currenlty removed from the list from first line therapy
  - Can **Antibiotics** treat COVID19?
    - no 
    - then why Azhithro / Doxy / Tetracycline 
    - to prevent secondary bacterial infection 
    - Azhitro has some anti-inflammatory properties as well 

## Challenges for new drugs 
- Pandemic situation
- No Rx available 
- Not enough drug information 
- New drug required; which takes time as noted above; requires clinical trial; even repurposing of approved drugs  

## Preclinical research
- By October 2020; 511 candidate compunds
- Animal models studies; we don't have specific animal models
- Alternative is cell culture model; but this is expensive   
- Only 19% reach next stage
- And it requires time

## Off label prescribing 
- For rare and neglected diseases 
- So, also in COVID19
- We are looking for serendipity

## Repurposing drugs 
- Accelerate identification of drugs that can cure COVID19
- these drugs are already proven to be safe and efficacious for other indication
- so, preclinical testing is not required 
- also reduced cost of research

## Clinical trials  
- Scientific, ethical and logistic challenges 
- Not all trials are equal 
- Rapid churning of research can be confusing 

## Pharmaceutical issues 
- Lot of raw material comes from China 

## Summing up
- Presicse therapy is yet being searched for 
- It requires time
- Quality of data being published needs to be looked at
- Patients' compliance 

# Comments by Expert 

Dr. Santanu Tripathy, Director, Clinical Research, John C Martin Centre for Liver Research and Innovations, Kolkata 

- Damage by virus have occured by day 6-7 of the symptom onset 
- Cytokines are the main cause of the inflammatory damage and Coagulatory dysfunction in COVID
- Leading to O2 deficit, inflammatory damage, Thromboembolic events, Thrombocytopenia 
- Antiviral has to be given early enough, no role of antiviral after day 9 as viral replication declines by that time 
- Drugs that seem to work
  - steroid; not to be used before day 7; methypred or dexa
  - anticoagulants 
  - O2 
  - monoclonal antibodies 
- Need for effective vaccine development
