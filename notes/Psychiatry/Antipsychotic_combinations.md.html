# Ground realites 
- 1 in 6 receives combination antipsychotics
- UK study 
- May be more in India [Data needs to be reviewed]

# Indications
- Cross tapering
- Resitant schizophrenia (reduce residual psychosis symptoms)
- To reduce eide effects of one antipsychotic (e.g. If clozapine induced wt gain or hyperprolactinemia then add arip to reduce wt gain or hyperprolcatinemia)

# Why we shouldn't combine?
- Little evidence base for combining non-clozpaine antipsychotic medications 
- Substantial evidence for harm
  - Increased side effects 
  - Reduced cognitive functions 
  - Combination over 10 year - increased risk of death 
  - 3 antipsychotic combination - 3 times risk of mortality
- Evidence suggests that even in case of Clozapine - combination=s improve tolerability but not efficacy

# Good practices 
- Antipsychotic polypharmacy should be avoided 
- Document rationalie for combining antipsychotics
- Monitor for side effects with greater acuity 
- Final target should be to stabilize the patient on one antipsychotic 
- Changing to single drug lead to better cognitive function [JRV view outcome in schizophrenia may be a more significant predictor of functional outcome]
