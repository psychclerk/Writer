**Q. What is the best prevention against negative symptoms?**

A. Psychotic illness should be **identified and treated as early as possible** as this may offer some protection against the development of negative symptoms.

**Q. Are antipsychotics effective against negative symptoms?**

- There are **no well‐replicated, large trials, or meta-analyses of trials**, with negative symptoms as the primary outcome measure that have yielded convincing evidence for enduring and clinically significant benefit. 
- Some improvement demonstrated in clinical trials, may be limited to secondary negative symptoms.
- For any given patient, the **antipsychotic that provides best balance between overall efficacy and adverse effects** should be used, at the lowest dose that maintains control of positive symptoms.

**Q. What to do when negative symptoms persist beyond an acute episode of psychosis?**

- Ensure **EPS** (specifically bradykinesia) and **depression** are detected and treated if present, and consider the **contribution of the environment** to negative symptoms (e.g. institutionalization, lack of stimulation).
- There is insufficient evidence at present to support a recommendation for any specific pharmacological treatment for negative symptoms. Nevertheless, a **trial of add‐on medication** for which there is some RCT evidence for efficacy, such as an antidepressant, may be worth considering in some cases, ensuring that the choice of the augmenting agent is based on minimizing the potential for compounding adverse effects through pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug interactions.
