<h1 id="context">Context</h1>

<ul>
<li>Case of 28 y/o, married, female, with pre-obese status.</li>
<li>At the time of first episode the patient was unmarried and had presented with euphoric mania, with family h/o of bipolar in brother and h/o good response to lithium in brother&#8217;s case.</li>
<li>1st episode was treated with Lithium and pt showed good response. She was continued on Lithium prophylaxis for 2&#8211;3 years. She stopped taking same since 6 months after she got married and moved to UP with her spouse.</li>
<li>2nd episode since 15 days, hypomanic, ppt with psychosocial stressor.</li>
<li><strong>Clinical question</strong> is whether to start Lithium / another MS / MS antipsychotic in this pt with active married life, UPT done today negative, but potential of bearing pregnancy in near future.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="maudsley13thedreviewandcaseresolution">Maudsley 13th ed review and case resolution</h1>

<ul>
<li>We have to treat her as if a pregnant woman</li>
<li>Risk of relapse during pregnancy if mood‐stabilizing medication is discontinued is high</li>
<li>The risks of not stabilizing mood include:

<ul>
<li>harm to the mother through poor self‐care, lack of obstetric care or self‐harm</li>
<li>harm to the fetus or neonate (ranging from neglect to infanticide).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="treatmentwithms">Treatment with MS</h2>

<h3 id="lithiumli">Lithium (Li)</h3>

<ul>
<li>crosses the placenta</li>
<li>Ebstein&#8217;s anomaly in fetus</li>
<li>Risk of malformations is overestimated</li>
<li>NICE recommends that if lithium is considered essential in a woman planning pregnancy, the woman be informed of the risk of fetal malformations and the risk of toxicity in the baby if lithium is continued during breastfeeding.</li>
<li>Hence, in this case <strong>lithium was not recommended</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="moodstabilizerscbzandvalp">Mood stabilizers (CBZ and VALP)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Both CBZ and VALP have a clear causal link with increased risk of a variety of fetal abnormalities, particularly neural tube defects including spina bifida.</li>
<li>NICE advises against the use of valproate in pregnancy</li>
<li>NICE advises discussing the possibility of stopping carbamazepine if a woman is planning a pregnancy or becomes pregnant</li>
<li>Hence, in this case <strong>Carbamazepine and Valproate were not recommended</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mslamotrigine">MS (Lamotrigine)</h3>

<ul>
<li>There is growing evidence that lamotrigine is safer in pregnancy than carbamazepine or valproate across a range of outcomes.</li>
<li>However, clearance of lamotrigine seems to increase radically during pregnancy and then reduces post partum so frequent lamotrigine levels are necessary.</li>
<li>This may become cumbersome if lamotrigine has to be continued during pregnancy.</li>
<li>Also, Lamotrigine does not have anti-manic potential, hence in this case <strong>lamotrigine was not recommended</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="antipsychotic">Antipsychotic</h3>

<ul>
<li>NICE recommends the <strong>use of mood‐stabilizing antipsychotics as a preferable alternative</strong> to continuation with a mood stabilizer.</li>
<li>In acute mania in pregnancy use an antipsychotic and if this is ineffective consider ECT.</li>
<li>NICE recommends <strong>avoiding depot preparations and anticholinergic drugs</strong> in pregnancy unless a depot is needed to keep a woman well through the perinatal period.</li>
<li>CAVEATS - Be aware that drug‐induced hyperprolactinaemia may prevent pregnancy. Consider switching to an alternative drug if hyperprolactinaemia occurs and a pregnancy is planned.</li>
<li>The most reproductive safety data are available for <strong>quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone and haloperidol</strong>, with more limited data for <strong>clozapine, aripiprazole and ziprasidone</strong>.</li>
<li>Hence, in this case <strong>olanzapine was recommended</strong> with plan to later shift to Arip once acute phase is controlled considering pre-obese status</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="depressiveepisode">Depressive episode</h3>

<ul>
<li>In bipolar depression during pregnancy use cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for moderate depression and an SSRI for more severe depression. Lamotrigine is also an option.</li>
</ul>
