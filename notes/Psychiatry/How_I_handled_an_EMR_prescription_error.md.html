# 15/6/21 Tuesday

68 year old male has been on irregular f/u with me for Adjustment disorder. Stressor - 3 sons have schizophrenia. Had come today to me with his son for seeking consulation for his son and for himself. 

the 68 y/o male has been self medicating with previous prescription medications as follows 
t. sertraline 50mg 0-0-1 
t. zolpidem 10mg 0-0-1
t. diazepam 5mg 0-0-1
 
since last 6 months 

he reported that he has not been able to sleep well, otherwies mood is stable. 

So, it was decided to give him following prescription. 

t. sertraline 50mg 0-0-1 
t. trazodone 25mg 0-0-1
x 1 month
 
t. zolpidem 10mg 0-0-1/2
t. diazepam 5mg 0-0-1/2
x 1 week and then omit

Just before the OPD was about the close I had an intution that I need to recheck todays prescritions, for the patients I have seen. On checking I found that for this gentelman I had inadverently entered trazodone 25mg 1-0-0 in the EMR. 

## How did I go about addressing this error?

1. I contacted the reception to give me the mobile number registered in the system. 
2. I called on this number, which was picked up by a gentleman who identified himself as the patients nephew. 
3. He gave me the mobile number of the patient. 
4. I called the patient on the number provided and explained the error that had occured and advised him to take the tablet trazodone 25mg in the night. And confirmed with hi mthat he had understood my instructions. 

I also entered the sequence of events in the EMR note. as follows [de-identified]

edit entered at 5pm - It was noted that trazodone has been inadvertently prescribed in the morning pts number was traced from registration [xxxxxxx] was picked by Mr. xxxxx, [pts nephew]. He was told that Mr. xxxx has consulted me today and I need to change the schedule of medications. So, please trace him an ask him to call me on my personal mobile number xxxxxx. 

Mr. xxxx also gave me number xxxxxx, on which I called from my personal mobile and explained the error to Mr. xxxxx. And asked Mr. xxxxx to take to t. Trazodone 25mg in the night. 

## Lessons 

- Relying on intution is also necessary - otherwise I would not have recognized this in time
- If an error has occured - address it appropriately
