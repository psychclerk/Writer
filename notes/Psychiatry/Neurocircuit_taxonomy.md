# Why understand neurocircuits?
- Dysfunctions within and between these circuits give rise to the symptoms that characterize mental disease.
- Understanding these dysfunctions offers the opportunity to specify symptoms at the level of the organ that generates themâ€”the brain.
- By doing so, the notion of mental disease could be revolutionized and treatments could be tailored according to individual experiences and underlying neural disconnections.

# Why there is a gap in neuroscience advances and their application in psychiatry?
- Language of brain circuit not incorporated into clinically meaningful taxanomy.
- Training programs do not provide training in neural circuit taxonomy.
- Practitioners do not have neuroiscience based decision making tools.

# Current diagnostic systems and neurocircuits taxonomy?
- Current systems like DSM-5 are syndromic and arguably conflate several types of individuals in who diverse brain dysfunctions drive symptoms.
- It is proposed that specific dysfunctions in the functional and structural connectivity of large-scale circuits that govern emotional, cognitive, and self-reflective functions define unique biotypes of depression and anxiety.
- These biotypes will probably differ from traditional diagnostic categories and are likely to overlap, interact, or co-occur in individual patients. A single mechanism is unlikely to underlie a broad descriptive diagnosis such as depression.
If a taxonomy based on brain dysfunctions is articulated, then it can be mapped onto the profiles of symptoms to which these dysfunctions give rise.
- Also help is reducing stigma - reformulate mental disorders as brain disorders.

- Legend
    - aMPFC = anterior medial prefrontal cortex
    - AG = Angular gyrus
    - PCC = posterior cingulate cortex
    - dACC = dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
    - aI = anterior Insula
    - TP = Temporal pole
    - EA = Extended amgygdala (BNST)
    - sgACC = subgenual ACC
    - pACC = pregenual ACC
    - MPFC = medial PFC
    - I = Insula
    - A - Amygdala
    - OFC = orbital frontal cortex
    - msPFC = medial superior PFC
    - LPFC = lateral PFC
    - aIPL = anterior Inferior parietal lobule
    - DLPFC = Dorsolateral PFC
    - PCG = precentral gyrus
    - DPC = dorsal parietal cortex
    - Nacc = nucleus accumbens
    - VTA = Ventral tegmental area

- 6 important ones
    - Self-reflection (DMN) = aMPFC, AG, PCC
    - Salience perception (SN) = dACC, aI, TP, EA
    - Negative affect = ACC(sgACC, dACC, pACC), MPFC, I, A
    - Positive affect (Reward) = dACC/MPFC, OFC, Striatum (Nacc + VTA)
    - Attention = msPFC, LPFC, aI, aIPL, Precuneus
    - Cognitive control (CEN, fronto-parietal) = DLPFC, PCG, DPC
- Other
    - Sensorimotor
    - Visual
    - Auditory
- DMN is task-negative (activity of the brain when doing nothing)
- CEN is task-postive
- DMN and CEN function in anti-correaltional manner

# How circuts can get marred?
- hypoactivation of node
- hyperactivation of node
- increased connectivity b/w nodes
- decreased connectivity b/w nodes

# Limitations of current research?
- Existing finding tend to be inconsistent
- probably because sample is heterogenous - meaning similar symptoms due to different circuit dysfunctions
- Hence future studies will first identify neural biotypes based on underlying circuit dysfunctions

[biotypes]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4922884/bin/nihms794824f2.jpg { width:100% }

## DMN
- Task-free or task negative condition (e.g. subject asked to reflect on their thoughts)
- Functional overactivation and hyperconnection of DMN in depression -> RUMINATIONS

## SN
- detects salient change in the environment - interoceptive and external
- after detection relay signal for further processing to CEN, which guides switching of function from DMN to CEN
- Insular-amygdala hypoconnection -> ANXIOUS AVOIDANCE
- Difficulty in differentiating relevant salient cues and an avoidance of situations that could generate stimulus overload

## Negative affect circuit
- Appraisal of negatively valenced stimuli
- Expression of emotions
- May be engaged in absence of concious sensory awareness
- commonly co-activated with the SN in response to negative stimuli
- NEGATIVE-BIASES
    - MDD pt -> shown sad face -> increased activation of insula + increased activation of amygdala
    - GAD pt -> shown emotional faces -> increased insular activation + Insular-amygdala hypoconnection
    - MDD pt -> at rest -> hyperconnectivity of anterior notes of the negative affect circuit and SN -> drives ruminations and negative attributions
- THREAT DYSREGULATION
    - Amygdala hyperactivation + ACC hypoactivation
    - Amygdala-ACC hypoconnection
    - leading to poor emotional regulation

## Positive affect circuit (Reward)
- ANHEDONIA
    - MDD pt -> happy faces -> hypoactivation of striatum -> loss of sensitivity to socially rewarding stimuli
    - also hyperactivation of OFC when shown happy faces
 - CONTEXT INSENSITIVITY
    - In remitted depression -> pt shown reward stimuli -> overactivation of     ACC
    - heightened anticipation of reward without sensitivity to surrounding context

## Attention circuit
- Alertness, sustained attention
- Switching b/w resting and task positive network
- hypoconnection of fronto-parietal network -> INATTENTION

## Cognitive control circuit
- Working memory and selective attention
- While effortful selective processing -> inability to inhibit irrelevant stimuli -> COGNITVE DYSCONTROL
