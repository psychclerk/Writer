# How Exercise changes the Brain?

Summary of Newspaper article and cited literature by Dr. Arash Javanbhakt, A psychiatrist and neuroscientist working as Associate Professor of Psychiatry, Wayne State University.

## Working out regularly really does change the brain biology. [Liegro et al](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/10/9/720)

- Brain is a very plastic organ 
- Aerobic and high-intensity interval training exercises [**significantly increase BDNF levels**](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/10/9/720)
- BDNF helps brains **increase neuronal connections**
- Key area is **hippocampus** involved in learning and memory and regulating negative emotions 
- Giving support to the old adage **"A sound mind in a sound body"**

## Other advantages of exercise 
- Animal studies suggest that exercise induced [**changes occur at epigentic level**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07508.x), meaning that exercise can have an impact on how genes are expressed.
- Moderate exercise also seems to have [**anti-inflammatory effects**](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00164.2004), regulating the immune system and excessive inflammation. Recent studies have implicated inflammatory mechanisms in the causation of depression and anxiety.  
- there is evidence for effects of exercise on [**increased levels of dopamine and endorphins**](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/10/9/720) in the brain; neurotransmitters that are involved in positive mood and motivation.
- Excercise is also an effective treatment having mild to moderate effect in reducing symptoms of [**depression**](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub5/full) and [**anxiety**](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3313-5).
