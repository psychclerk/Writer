# Basic pathology
- Group of disorders in which there is **brain iron accumulation** within the central nervous system esp
- **basal ganglia and substantia Nigra**
- Genetically characterized causes
	- PKAN (mutation in PANK2, chromosome 20, AR) aka Hallervorden-Spatz (name no longer used due to ethical reasons)
	- Aceuruloplasminemia
	- Neuroferritinopathy
- However, vast majority are in residual group that has not genetically characterized

# Clinical features

## Classic childhood-onset cases
- U/L slowly progressive dystonia involving the extremities and the face -> B/L
- Dysarthria
- Choreoathetosis may occur
- Minority of patients may develop spasticity
- 1/4th will become demented
- death occurring within 10-15 years

## Adolescent or adult onset
- May also present with dystonia, but this is generally relatively mild.
- Choreoathetosis and parkinsonism may appear, as may spasticity, and most will also develop dysarthria.
- Small minority present with tics, and such patients may later also develop obsessions and compulsions.
- 1/3rd develop dementia - personality change with impulsivity, aggressive outbursts, and emotional lability.
- Rarely, adult onset cases may present with a dementia, followed years later by a movement disorder
- leisurely pace

This sign has some specificity for PKAN, but may also be seen in other cases.

# DD
- Where presenting primarily with dystonia - other conditions presenting with dystonia e.g. primary torsion dystonia, DRD, WD
- When presenting primarily with parkinsonism - PD and PD plus
- When tics - HD

# Rx
- Symptomatic
	- dystonia
	- parkinsonism
	- dementia
- DBS - relief for 1 year
