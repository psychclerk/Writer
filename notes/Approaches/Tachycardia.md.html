2. Length of QRS
3. Regularity of rhythm

# Assessment
## History taking
### Define cardiac symptoms
- Palpitations
    - Continuous v/s Paroxysmal
    - Regular v/s irregular
- Other cardiac sx
    - hemodynamic compromise
        - chest pain
        - SOB
        - syncope / pre-syncope
    - HF
        - Orthopnea
        - PND
        - swollen ankles
    - MI
        - pain : character
        - N/V
        - sweating

### Etiologic history
   - Sepsis (Fever, rigor, presyncope/syncope, symptoms related to infective source)
   - Dehydration (diarrhea, vomiting, reduced oral intake, blood loss)
   - Hyperthyroidism (heat intolerance, weight loss, oligomenorrhea)
   - Anxiety (parasthesia, stressors)
   - Exercise
   - Medication history (any new medications or dose change, particularly sympathomimetic or anticholinergic)
   - Alcohol use / other substance use
   - Caffine use

### Past medical and psychiatric history
  - Any cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, chronic lung disease, anxiety, panic
  - Eating disorder (purging behavior may be associated with electrolyte distrubance)

### Family history
  - sudden cardiac death

## Examination
- ABCDE assessment
- Cardiovascular examination
- Focused examination if systemic illness suspected
- MSE to look for psych symptoms associated with autonomic activation e.g. anxiety, delusions, hallucinations

## Investigations
- ECG

<img src="../../attachments/ECG_tachycardia.png" style='width:100%;'>

- Bloods
  - CBC (anaemia, high/low neutrophil count)
  - RFT (hypovolaemia, hypokalaemia/hyperkalaemia)
  - Bone profile (hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia)
  - CRP (infection)
  - TFT (hyperthyroidism)
  - Antipsychotic levels (toxicity)
  - Trop-I (if suspecting an ischaemic event or myocarditis)
  - D‐dimer
  - BNP (heart failure)
  - HbA1c (diabetes mellitus)
  - RBS (diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state).
- Urine
  - toxicology (cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis).
  - dipstick (urinary tract infection, ketonuria, glycosuria).
- CXR (cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema, pneumonia, lung cancer).Urine dipstick
- Special Ix
  - Consider echocardiogram or 24‐hour tape

# Management

## Sinus Tachycardia

- 🚩 Sinus tachycardia may represent a physiological response, attempts to slow the heart rate in this context may result in hypotension
- 🚩 Red flag symptoms including persistent chest pain, syncope, hypotension, pyrexia, tachypnoea or hypoxia may necessitate transfer
- If a specific cause is identified, management should focus on treatment of the underlying condition.
- In psychiatric inpatients, if agitation or panic is suspected but alternative diagnoses cannot initially be discounted (e.g. evolving infection), then increasing frequency of observations and clinical reviews may be indicated, even if only temporarily.

- **Clozapine induced sinus tachycardia**
  - Very common in the early stages of treatment
  - usually benign and dose related
  - If ***Asymptomatic patients***
    - And no signs of myocarditis (e.g fever or chest pain)
    - Then, manage conservatively
  - If ***Symptomatic***
    - Then, start rate control with Beta-blockers
    - Else, start Ivabradine
  - If ***first line rx fails***
    - consider p/o cardiomyopathy and seek Cardiac consult

## AF
- General principles involve offering symptomatic patients rate control (e.g. a beta‐blocker) and anticoagulation if the risk of thromboembolism is high (CHA2DS2VASc score ≥2) but not outweighed by the risk of major bleeding (calculated using the HAS‐BLED score).
- Anticoagulants could include warfarin or apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, endoxaban.

## SVT
- 🚩 Persistent new‐onset SVT requires immediate transfer.
- Further acute management may involve intravenous adenosine administration, synchronised cardioversion or intravenous antiarrhythmics such as diltiazem or beta‐blockers.
- Long‐term management should be directed by a cardiologist. Lifestyle advice on alcohol, caffeine, and illicit drug use as potential precipitants should be offered,as well as strict control of general cardiac risk factors (e.g. smoking cessation).

## Broad-complex tachycardia

- 🚩 Any broad‐complex tachycardia should be managed as VT until proven otherwise
- For psychiatric inpatients or people in the community, this is likely to require urgent transfer.

## When to refer

- 🚩 Red flags
- haemodynamic instability
- significant breathlessness
- chest pain
- syncope or near syncope
- family history of sudden cardiac death under 40
- symptoms precipitated by exercise.
- Suspected VT
- Suspected SVT
- AF with evidence of complications (e.g stroke or HF)
- Evidence of concurrent illness that necessitates admission (e.g. sepsis)
