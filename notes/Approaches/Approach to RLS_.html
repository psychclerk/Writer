# Introduction
Prompted to write the article after encounter with a female patient with anxiety disorder, now euthymic but still reporting c/o vague pain in the legs during night and causing delay in sleep. Previous clinicians missed to consider RLS as a cause of her symptoms. A review of medical h/o suggested that she has h/o irregular menses, but her recent thyroid function was WNL. A review of her medical records showed that the pt was prone to anemia and had an Hb of 6.3 in 2018 for which she was medically treated then. However, she has not recently undergone CBC and had pallor on clinical examination. Patient was asked to get CBC, Serum Iron study and follow up with a preferred physician. 

**"Consider restless legs syndrome (RLS) in the differential  diagnosis  whenever  a  patient  reports  leg  or  arm  discomfort in the evening/night or insomnia"**

**Because RLS may be the only clinical indication of iron deficiency, clinicians should consider determining the serum ferritin level in all patients with RLS**

# Epidemiology
- common neurological movement disorder that affects approximately **10 percent of adults**
- approximately **one third have symptoms severe enough** to require medical therapy
- **F** ">" M

# Etiology
1. Primary
2. Secondary
	- Iron deficiency
	- Pregnancy
	- Renal failure
	- Medications
	- Spinal cord injury

# Pathophysiology
- Efficacy of dopamine agonists in the management of RLS gives credence to possibility of dopamine system abnormalities
- Same way increased incidence in patients with iron deficiency suggest CNS iron abnormalities 
- Genetic studies have found 8 loci associated with RLS

# Assessment 
## History
### Symptoms 
**URGE** mnemonic 
- U=urge to move the legs, usually associated with unpleasant leg sensations
- R=rest induces symptoms;
- G=getting active (physically and mentally) brings relief
- E=evening and night make symptoms worse
### R/o Differentials
- **Akathisia**:  internal desire to move, most commonly associated with the use of neuroleptic medications
- **Nocturnal leg cramps**: Sudden involuntary muscle contractions; palpable tightening of the leg muscles
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: generally causes sensory disturbance; may or may not be more noticeable at night; **not typically relieved by activity**
- **Peripheral vascular disease**: cramping-type pains that are **exacerbated by activity and improve with rest**; symptoms not worse at night
- **Periodic Limb Movements of Sleep:** Approximately 80 percent of individuals with RLS experience PLMS, but less than one half of individuals with PLMS also have RLS
### Impact
- Sleep disturbance
- Reduced QOL
- Anxiety / Depression
### Etiologic history
- Any medications? Previous treatments? 
- use of caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco?
- Medical ROS: anemia, liver dz, renal dz, thyroid, LMP, sun-exposure, diet
- Family h/o

## Exam
- Neurological exam
- Stigmata of secondary causes 

# Laboratory 
- A laboratory analysis is not necessary for the diagnosis, but it can help exclude secondary causes of RLS. Initial laboratory tests include 
-  CBC
-  Serum Ferritin
-  TSH
-  Creat, Electrolytes 
-  SGOT/PT
-  B12 and Vit D is suspecting low based on h/o 

**SCALES** to assess severity

# Mx
## Medications
- Dopamine agonists (main); dose  has  to  be  kept  low  within  the  range  recommended  for  RLS,  which  is  much  lower  than the doses used in Parkinson’s disease
- Gabapentin / Pregabalin; gabapentin derivatives are preferred over dopamine agonist since they do not cause augmentation
- Levodopa
- Opioid
- Benzos

## Severity based management

### Intermittent RLS*
- Nonpharmacologic therapies
	- Administer iron replacement in patients who are iron-deficient (Of note, RLS does not always respond to an increasing serum ferritin concentration, even if it was low initially)
	- Consider effect of medications that may enhance RLS 
		- antidepressants, neuroleptic agents, dopamine-blocking anti-emetics such as metoclopramide or sedating antihistamines (including those found in nonprescription medications)
		-  **if antidepressants are deemed necessary**, the symptoms can usually be treated in the same way as primary RLS. Alternatively, use of bupropion can be considered because this antidepressant has been shown to reduce periodic limb movements in depressed patients and thus may be less likely to induce or worsen RLS
	- Recommend mental alerting activities ( such as video games or crossword puzzles, to reduce symptoms at times of boredom)
	- Suggest abstinence from caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol
- Medications
	- Benzodiazepines
	- Carbidopa/levodopa
	- Dopamine agonists
	- Low-potency opioids

### Daily RLS†
- Nonpharmacologic therapy
	- Dopamine agonists (drug of choice in most people with RLS)
	- Gabapentin; if ineffective as first-line therapy, a dopamine agonist should be considered
	- Low-potency opioids; if ineffective as first-line therapy, a dopamine agonist should be considered

### Refractory RLS‡ (Consider referral to sub-specialist)
- Change to different dopamine agonist
- Change to gabapentin
- Change to a high-potency opioid or tramadol
- Consider adding a second agent, such as gabapentin, a Benzodiazepines, or an opioid

*— Intermittent RLS requires treatment when present, but does not occur frequently enough to require daily therapy.

†— Daily RLS occurs frequently enough to require daily therapy.

‡— Refractory RLS is treated daily with a dopamine agonist and results in one or more of the following outcomes: the initial response is inadequate despite adequate doses; the response has become inadequate over time, despite increasing doses; the treatment results in intolerable adverse effects; the treatment results in augmentation that was not controllable with additional earlier doses of the drug.
