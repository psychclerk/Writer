# Introduction

Patients should be assessed when they or their families complain of depressive symptoms and when a mood disorder is suspected clinically.

Rating scales are routinely used to **screen for mood disorders.** Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a popular tool with 93% sensitivity and 81% specificity. It on its own is not sufficient for diagnosis.

Currently one to one interview will be done with those who **score more than 15 on PHQ-9 (LR of MDE 7) or scoring 1 or more on question 9 of PHQ-9** (suicidal ideation)

# Evaluation should include
## Symptoms of depression
More emphasis must be placed on psychological symptoms
  - dysphoria
  - anhedonia
  - hopelessness
  - feelings of guilt

Because vegetative and somatic symptoms are common to the experience of cancer and it's treatment as well as depression

## Rule out syndromic differentials
Hypoactive delirium, Cognitive impairment - can be comorbid with depression

## Look for comorbidities
Anxiety, psychosis, mania, cognitive impairments, substance use

## Past Psychiatric h/o
Depression and suicidal attempts

## Look for etiological factors
**Drugs** - corticosteroids, especially in chronic use, may cause depressive syndromes and acutely may cause presentations consistent with mania.

**Central nervous system depressant medications**, including opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates, may cause depression in patients with idiosyncratic vulnerability or with cognitive impairments.

**Anti-neoplastic drugs** - Depressive syndromes may be encountered as side effects of vinca alkyloids; L-asparaginase; procarbazine; of much greater concern are biological response modifiers including interferon-alpha and interleukin-2 (IL-2). Interferon especially is associated with depression and may occasionally cause mania.

**Unrelieved pain** - is a significant cause of depression in cancer patients. Rate pain on a scale of 0-10.

**Social support** - level of social support and social isolation to be assessed

## Risk assessment
**Suicidal ideations** (it is fairly common for cancer patients to have passive suicidal ideations with no active desire to die, or plan.)

Most of the generic risk factors for suicide (SADPERSONS) are already covered in the protocol above. Specific cancer related risks are advanced disease and unrelieved pain.

Conducted in an open, nonjudgmental manner, gives the patient permission  to talk about thoughts that may be very frightening.

Slightly indirect approach to the question of suicide risk may be helpful at first. The patient might be asked if he ever has thoughts that life is no longer worth living; if yes, does he have thoughts of ending his own life and if so, does he have a plan?

# Common diagnoses to consider
## Major depression
Diagnosis of primary or secondary major depression will experience one or both of the hallmark emotional symptoms of depression (dysphoria, anhedonia) and at least five of the listed symptoms. DSM-5 criteria also require the presence of vegetative and/or somatic symptoms, which, with psychological symptoms, must be present for at least two weeks and represent a distinct change from prior function

## Adjustment disorder
Adjustment disorders (also known as “minor depression” or “reactive depression”) are the most common mood disorders diagnosed in cancer patients. The diagnosis requires that the patient experiences sadness or inability to take pleasure in life as a response to a stressor like cancer temporally related to the onset of symptoms, and that the symptoms are sufficiently severe that they cause impairment of social or occupational function. They may not meet criteria for major depression or secondary mood disorders because low mood is not persistent.

## Primary or Secondary Mania
Elevated and expansive or irritable mood and rapid or pressured speech. Thought processes can seem illogical. Patients often experience a decreased need for sleep, increased energy and impulsive or erratic behavior. Patients may speak of depressed mood when they are irritable.

# Management
## Medication management
### Antidepressants
- Use of antidepressants is a matter or clinical judgement
- Patients who meet criteria for major depression should be treated.
- Patients with severe adjustment disorders or who do not meet full criteria for depression may also benefit from antidepressant therapy.
- Almost all the antidepressants available in general clinical practice can be used in cancer patients.
- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants (citalopram, fluoxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline) and the newer combination agents
(bupropion, duloxetine, venlafaxine, mirtazapine) are used most frequently in oncology because of their safety and generally favorable side effect profiles.
- Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are potentially problematic because of anticholinergic and anti-alpha-adrenergic effects. However, they are inexpensive and can be useful in patients with co-morbid neuropathic pain syndromes.
- They take anywhere from 2–4 weeks to take effect.
- Patients should be monitored for side effects and response of symptoms.
- Seriously ill and elderly patients should be started at low doses, with cautious dose escalation if the drug is tolerated.
- Continue for 4–6 months of sustained response before considering discontinuation.

### Psychostimulants
- modafinil
- methylphenidate.
- Can be very beneficial in treatment of associated fatigue, mild cognitive impairment, and anorexia, especially in advanced and end-stage disease settings.
- More rapid effect than standard antidepressants
- Generally well tolerated but can have adverse effects on blood pressure

### Mood Stabilizers and Antipsychotics
- Cancer patients with preexisting bipolar mood disorder ideally should be maintained on mood stabilizers (i.e., lithium, valproic acid) and antipsychotic medications.
- Dehydration associated with treatment-associated vomiting and diarrhea can affect lithium levels, which should be monitored closely during active treatment.
- Steroid-induced mania will usually respond to decrease of steroid doses.
- In some cases this is not feasible and the patient will require treatment with an antipsychotic drug such as olanzapine.

### Generic comment on medications
- Drug-drug interactions and possible cardiac conduction abnormalities should be monitored.

## Management of Suicide threat
- Safety of patients at risk for suicide must be secured.
- Do not leave alone until they can be evaluated and started in treatment.
- May need to pursue admission to hospital.
- Any disease and treatment related factors (especially pain) that may be contributing to the presenting mood disorder should be addressed.

## Psychotherapy for Mood Disorders
Supportive psychotherapy in patients with major and minor depression is almost universally appropriate as one element of treatment.
- Goal: decrease perception of isolation and bolster coping skills.
- Support can be provided by members of the primary team and also by allied health professionals including social workers and chaplains.
- More formal and structured psychotherapy may be appropriate on a case-by-case basis. This usually involves referral to a mental health professional of any discipline with appropriate training.

## Other non-pharmacological intreventions
### Spiritual inteventions - FICA assessment
Faith, Importance, Community, Address Questions. Spirituality is an important part of many people’s lives and provides a sense of connectedness and comfort during times of illness and distress. Cancer often precipitates a spiritual crisis as a person searches for meaning in their life and illness. Spirituality is evaluated by questions around four main themes to guide history taking and give a better sense of the patient’s dependence on spirituality in coping with illness. They are not scored and focus on strengths. The four themes—faith, importance, community, address—can be remembered using the acronym, FICA

  **F**: What is your faith or belief?
  Do you consider yourself spiritual or religious?
  What things do you believe in that give meaning to your life?

  **I**: Is it important in your life?
  What influence does it have on how you take care of yourself?
  How have your beliefs influenced your behavior during this illness?
  What role do your beliefs play in regaining your health?

  **C**: Are you part of a spiritual or religious community?
  Is this of support to you and how?
  Is there a person or group of people you really love or who are really important to you?

  **A**: How would you like me, your health-care provider, to address these issues in your health care?

  ### Meditation
  With cancer specific suggestions. Recording of PMR with soothing music and cancer specific suggestions will be shared with pateints or family members for daily practice.
